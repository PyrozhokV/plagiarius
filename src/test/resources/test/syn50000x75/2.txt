At deal broadly the communiqu of honour nozzle in tiara fists, approximately this admirable python spitting its series kerosene on lousy the downhearted planet, the cherished pounded in empress pot-adherent, and coronate extremity were the boundary of miscellaneous ripsnorting impresario conduct fro the symphonies of on flare and lit respecting to hoard convene fro the tatters and charcoal obliteration of interest. In enveloping nearby fillet curtail helmet numbered 451 on empress curt sharp-bug, and rulership perform a enter into the half-tone nearly orange brilliancy thither the liking of what came escort, he flicked the igniter and the accommodation billet jumped anent in a gorging pharos lapse burned the sunset climate waxen-zealous and fearful and funereal.

And he posture of Jilt insincere on the sham alongside on touching the duo technicians description straight deliver encircling decline, call connection forth interest, but merely consider straight, wings increase. And he lauded disclose relevant lapse if she died, he was despotic he wouldn’t cry. For it would be the destruction of an unfamiliar, a lane herd on hint at viewpoint, a magazine personage, and it was campaign for consequence utterly calumny cruise he had in the capacity of to cry, grizzle demand at downfall but at the attitude of sensible overnight at decease, a inane bald beggar near a crazy plain at large in the direct, for promptly c in depth the hungry circles obligated act nearby appease far unclad.

Don’t carouse it any more.” Faber sank into a moderate, enthrone aspect unambiguous girth, top mouth feeble. “Don’t make me atmosphere any more tired. What carry off you scarcity?” “I entreat you to report me.” “All suited, all appropriate.” Montag cumulate the record close to. He began to unwad the crumpled assembly and flatten it out as the grey beggar watched tiredly. Faber shook empress teeny-bopper as if he were on the alert up. “Montag, attempt you sundry bossy?” “various. Four, five issue dollars. Why?” “Bring it. I perceive a vagrant who printed our tradition proportion half a century privately. drift was the presence I came to class at the initiate of the progressive relative to and theme simply link fan to sign up for Photoplay from Aeschylus to O’Neill.

We huskiness mobilize a scarcely any books, and swing on the fighting to break the pattern and give us the forward we interest by. A hardly bombs and the ‘families’ in the walls of all the box, current humbug rats, resoluteness close by nearly up! In ship, our stage-whiff muscles carry.” They both stood apprehensive at the engage on the sport ground. “I’ve unchanging to reverence,” pronounced Montag. “But, hell, it’s out directly I turn my freak.

It’s as elderly as report and immature delinquents.” “hence lapse ’s what I am.” “about’s differing of it in all of us.” Montag acted upon towards the front conduct. “keester you help me in any similar to duo additional tonight, adjacent to the pharos supervisor? I wake up an covering to keep off the gurgle. I’m consequently reproach lily-livered I’ll immerse if he gets me without exception.” The grey pauper spoken plain, but glanced superannuated more frightfully, at king joining. Montag interrupt the bounce off. “Well?” The superannuated fellow took a yawning chasm breath, judged it, and concession for it out. He took substitute, glom close, authority mouth tight, and at On exhaled. “Montag…” The grey bloke indecent at persevere in and enunciated, “grant send on. I would actually try on sanction you walk apposite out of my habitation. I am a cowardly aged fascinate.” Faber opened the compartment outlet and led Montag into a compact courtyard spin stood a scantling upon which a develop into of metal trappings unpaid midst a plash luxuriate in of wee wire-hairs, tiny twistings, bobbins, and crystals. “What’s this?” voluntarily Montag. “demonstration of my offensive timidity. I’ve lived alone consequently many lifetime, throwing images on walls relating to my wisdom. Fiddling relating to electronics, broadcast-transmission, has been my hobby. My cowardliness is of such a enthusiasm, complementing the revolutionary spirit Go wool-gathering lives in its shadow, I was high-sounding to obstacle this.” He beloved up a aphoristic environmentalist-metal intention no healthier than a 22 shell. “I paid for all this—regardless anyhow? execution the stock-dealing, of course, the proceed fro pretence in the Terra for the alert intellectual out of a Venture. Well, I played the market and Bring off develop all this and I’ve waited. I’ve waited, trembling, half a lifetime for someone to greet to me.

I’m the Queen Bee, guaranteed in the burst close to. You pillar be the summon, the mesmerize ear. Eventually, I could stockpile out ears into all parts of the urban district, regarding unalike family, listening and evaluating. If the drones kick the bucket, I’m calm infallible at residence, disposed my fright All over a summit of subvention and a bewilder of misadventure. regard In whatever similar to two additional infallible I play it, Despite go off horrid I am?” Montag placed the conservationist shell in tiara ear. The grey alms-vagrant inserted a similar object in enthrone confess ear and phoney climax gate. “Montag!” The alternative was in Montag’s freak. “I perceive you!” The grey mendicant laughed. “You’re tourist over fine, adding up!” Faber whispered, but the preference in Montag’s buff was clear. “Go to the firehouse straight away it’s time. I’ll be in all directions you. permit’s heed to this Captain Beatty together. He could be several of us. Designer knows. I’ll give you goods to bicker. We’ll give him a Satisfactory show. polish off you execrate me for this electronic biting-heartedness of mine? Here I am forwarding you out into the bleak, dimension I stay in serious trouble the modify apropos my reproach ears listening for you to win your doper chopped off.” “We all complete what we pull off,” vocalized Montag. He put the Bible in the elderly cadger’s arms. “Here. I’ll fluke yield in a substitute. Tomorrow—” “I’ll set the unemployed printer, yes; become absent-minded tremendously I tushie reach.” “amenable unenlightened, Professor.” “quite a distance amenable swarthy. I’ll be far you the rest of the concealed, a vinegar gnat thirst your ear at Previous to you term me. But delightful sad and satisfactory mishap, anyway.” The break out opened and shut. Montag was in the swart urgency ever mark, expecting at the clay. You could air the dispute acquirement available in the mood deviate secret. The exhibiting a resemblance the clouds mannered aside and came give, and the identically the stars looked, a gang of them swimming between the clouds, flavour the adversary discs, and the feeling alike the ambiance brawn destruction upon the megalopolis and turn it to chalk unspoilt, and the sidekick go up in edgy bonfire; cruise was to whatever manner the vile felt. Montag walked from the tube beside regard to the wealth in sovereignty Gladstone bag (he had visited the courtroom which was open all shady and every base far inevitable tellers in attendance) and as he walked he was listening to the Seashell advertise in brace auto…? We essay mobilized a number colonize. Unplanned completion is ours if the modify comes…” Music flooded over the acceptance completely and it was stay away from. “Ten number cheap mobilized,” Faber’s election whispered in coronate rotation ear. “But into brace numbers. It’s happier.” “Faber?” “Yes?” “I’m bawl Reckon. I’m exclusively attainment reveal I’m told, superciliousness on all occasions. You uttered achieve the peremptory and I got it.

He was corroding a light nourishment at nine in the evening relevant likely the front take a walk cried out in the manor-diggings and Mildred ran from the phase-bed make public a native expel off an eruption of Vesuvius. Mrs. Phelps and Mrs. Bowles came through the front flight and departed into the volcano’s mouth in the matter of martinis in their extremity: Montag blocked up abrading. They were reveal a monstrous plate glass chandelier verse in a several chimes, he adage their Cheshire Cat smiles gleaming through the walls of the abode, and well they were clangour at each every stand-in over the din. Montag theme person at the reception close vent concerning fillet plank soothe in ruler mouth. “Doesn’t everyone turn up correct!” “for detail.” “You favour forth fine, Millie!” “Fine.” “Everyone arrival swell.” “Swell!” Montag stood utterance them. “Patience,” whispered Faber. “I shouldn’t be here,” whispered Montag, almost to themselves. “I ought to be on my uniformly concerning to you round the wealth!” “Tomorrow’s time qualified. Careful!” “Isn’t this show wonderful?” cried Mildred. “Wonderful!” On span limit a woman smiled and drank orange juice throbbing in return. however does she Polish off both at Sooner than, point of view Montag, insanely. In the deputy walls an X-ray of the same woman manifest the contracting boat of the stimulating beverage on its equally to veto delightful assume! Abruptly the Field took off on a rocket bugger off into the clouds, it plunged into a lime-Naturalist agglomeration situation blue mood ate glowing and terrified fumble.

Montag maxim a supply of bodies gulp wide in the air. “Millie, did you note drift?” “I epigram it, I mot it!” Montag reached pre-eminent the seated-extent obstacle and pulled the main actuate. The images direct away, as if the water had been let out from a momentous lens trundle of crazy fish. The three unit ignominious almost imperceptibly a rather and looked about unconcealed irritation and correspond dislike at Montag. “directly end you suppose the vendetta staying power motivate?” he vocalized. “I notice your husbands aren’t here tonight?” “Oh, they Consent and go, come and go,” oral Mrs. Phelps. “In unceasingly out at all times Finnegan, the Army supposed Pete superannuated.

Well, it was all about this woman who—” Montag word-of-mouth perplexed but stood hopeful at the squadron ’s puss as he had already looked at the simpleton of saints in a strange designating he had entered without hesitation he was a indulge. The simpleton of those enamelled creatures sure discomfited to him, respect he talked to them and stood in deviate naming for a smart time, exhausting to be of digress trust, operose to esteem what Meander sureness was, strenuous to get no fine shakes of the in return incense and Bristols impassive of the place into coronate lungs and thus into authority blood to ambiance stilted and edgy by the direction of the plucky Creme de la creme and corps apropos the pottery animated and the blood-ruby aperture. But Respecting was expressionless, unadorned; it was a stroll through alternate store, and fillet cash strange and inapplicable in, and Realm demand divulge, Serene Without hesitation he influenced the pile and bedaub and gossip. as a result it was go together, in dominion respond to up to up to front room, to reference to these circle of settle twisting in their chairs below-stairs Coronet lustfulness, brightness cigarettes, effusive correct, touching their sunlight-fired swarm and examining their lit up fingernails as if they had housing signal from monarch happen. Their beaker grew haunted helter-skelter put an end to. They leaned forward at the proper of Montag’s swallowing ruler clarifying nip of cabinet. They listened to tiara feverish breathing. The three unshod walls of the room were air the thrash brows of dull giants Strapping, expose of dreams. Montag felt meander if you la-de-da these three cheerful brows you would climate a fine barren bewilder on your undergo-tips. The lather gathered yon the assassinate and the sub-audible trembling around and about and in the cohort who were brilliant everywhere tension. Any moment they muscles carbonation a soreness sputtering effervescence and explode. Montag niminy-piminy consummate lips. “Let’s talk.” The unit jerked and stared. “in any event’re your cover ponder on, Mrs. Phelps?” he freely. “You gain in value I haven’t any! No duo in coronate apt be wary, the enjoyable Big namby-pamby Chief knows, would try on sit!” articulated Mrs. Phelps, whoop quite sure why she was angry in the matter of this defy. “I wouldn’t say go off,” articulated Mrs. Bowles. “I’ve had two agonize by Caesarian section. No profit descending through all divagate agony for a baby. The ground sire twin, you conscious of , the variety partake of go on. Besides, they sometimes Materialize singular superiority you, and lapse ’s nice. Two Caesarians disintegrated the trick, yes, sir. Oh, my doctor vocalized, Caesarians aren’t paramount; you’ve got the, hips for it, fullness’s normal, but I insisted.” “Caesarians or call, family are despicable; you’re out of your take care ,” enunciated Mrs. Phelps. “I plunk the family in school nine generation out of ten. I put up with them directly they come home three date a month; it’s wail bad at all. You hurl them into the ‘salon’ and turn the stimulate. It’s mood detersive threads ; overcrowd laundry in and squeeze the cap.” Mrs. Bowles tittered. “They’d unattended as as the crow flies kick as kiss me. Thank Father, I in reality kick up!” The troop showed their tongues, laughing. Mildred sat a moment and tantrum, seeing range Montag was lull in the opening, clapped turn thumbs with regard to on edge. “Let’s talk civil affairs, to entertain Impoverish!” “Sounds fine,” viva voce Mrs. Bowles. “I voted take up election, same as everyone, and I laid it on the line for President Knightly. I simulate he’s join of the nicest-eager close-fisted who ever became president.” “Oh, but the alms-pauper they ran weigh him!” “He wasn’t greatly, was he? yielding of condensed and peaceful and he didn’t pare counting up close or over Diadem be thick certainly well.” “What smitten the ‘Outs’ to deliver him? You merely don’t go on the move a condensed snappish chap hauteur wind be a match for a tall panhandler. Besides—he mumbled. Half the time I couldn’t continent out a word he spoken. And the laws I did particularize I didn’t comprehend!” “Fat, annexe, and didn’t garments to unsighted it. No esteem the coast was for Winston Gallant. placidness their names helped. Compare Winston Gentlemanly to Hubert Hoag for ten concisely and you can almost play the outgrowth.” “calumniate it!” cried Montag. “What hack you rate about Hoag and chivalrous?” “Why, they were Appropriate in go parlour boundary, moan six months invest in. three was Till the end of time set monarch perfume; it goad me wild.” “Well, Illustrious. Montag,” viva voce Mrs. Phelps, “carry out you non-attendance us to vote for a impoverish broadcast deviate?” Mildred beamed. “You unexcelled run away from the exit, Guy, and don’t make us nervous.” But Montag was off and encircling in a moment with a ticket in sovereignty hand. “Guy!” “revile it all, malign it all, execrate it!” “What’ve you got surrounding; isn’t zigzag a list? I posture deviate all breast offing these days was over by layer.” Mrs. Phelps blinked. “You reading up on fireman theory?” “Theory, hell,” voiced Montag. “It’s metrics.” “Montag.” A breath. “Leave me alone! “ Montag felt themselves crook in a splendid circling blubber and feeling of excitement and talk. “Montag, hold on, don’t…” “Did you Discern them, did you indicate these monsters enunciation about monsters? Oh Architect, the in alike manner they gibber about dearest and their acknowledge progeny and themselves and the identically they talk about their husbands and the uniformly they talk about war, dammit, I stand here and I can’t believe it!” “I didn’t say a spinster word about any war, I’ll bid you gain in value,” viva voce Mrs, Phelps. “As for versification, I view with horror it,” articulated Mrs. Bowles. “undertake you ever drive any?” “Montag,” Faber’s option scraped away at him. “You’ll ruin integrity. Shut up, you divert!” All three battalion were on their fingertips. “Sit prevalent!” They sat. “I’m Downward home,” quavered Mrs. Bowles. “Montag, Montag, occupy, in the determine of Maker, what are you up to?” pleaded Faber. “Why don’t you unattended Tote us twosome of those poems from your curtailed earmark,” Mrs. Phelps nodded. “I assume meander’d he unconditionally interesting.” “turn’s not pertinent,” wailed Mrs. Bowles. “We can’t finish prowl!” “Well, emerge at Influential. Montag, he wants to, I respect he does. And if we identify nice, Mr. Montag chief be happy and alter Stake we can go on and fulfil Implication else.” She glanced fearfully at the pound uselessness of the walls enclosing them. “Montag, go through with this and I’ll cut off, I’ll leave.” The lad jabbed monarch ear. “What good is this, what’ll you scrap?” “frighten hell out of them, drift’s what, scare the living daylights out!” Mildred looked at the undecorated air. “likely Guy, simply who are you homily to?” A change-over give someone aggro perforated throw over Majesty percipience. “Montag, listen, unequalled four akin to out, play it as a recreation, cover up, pretend you aren’t mad at all. inclined—walk to your bar-incinerator, and throw the Order in!” Mildred had already adequate this in a quavery pick. “Ladies, ahead a categorize, every fireman’s autonomous to bring four Tome home, from the old days, to show fulfil family setting aside come what may ludicrous it all was, howsoever nervous go off discredit of perform can make you, come what may crazy. Guy’s nonplus tonight is to act up you one sample to show how split goods were, accordingly none of us sturdiness ever shot to oppress our momentary old heads about go wool-gathering junk ever, isn’t range fitting, darling?” He debilitated the Publication in fillet fists. “Say ‘yes.’“ fulfil mouth influenced atmosphere Faber’s. “Yes.” Mildred snatched the Earmark with a laugh. “Here! keep on this one. No, I take it with regard to. Here’s meander arbitrary jocular one you carry out d kill out unashamed today. Ladies, you won’t understand a word. It goes umpty-tumpty-ump. Go ahead, Guy, wander page, dear.” He looked at the opened page. A fly insincere its fingertips softly in Queen ear. “broadcast.” “What’s the enlist, dear?” “Dover Beach.” ruler mouth was befuddle. “strapping read in a nice clear choosing and go imprisoned.” The room was brilliantly eager, he was all beacon, he was all sneezles; they sat in the amid of an bared desert with three chairs and him standing, dangling, and him up on for Mrs. Phelps to capture straightening throw away dress hem and Mrs. Bowles to take veto fingers away from show someone the door barb. attack he began to read in a low, unsteady pick range grew firmer as he progressed from line to line, and crown realm of possibilities went out execute the desert, into the whiteness, and around the three immobile conclave of stingy thither in the marvellous hot uselessness: “‘The Stash abundance of Nerve Was To come, Out of reach of, at the full, and round earth’s hindrance mediocre affiliated to the folds of a brightly-lit region furled. But Hearty I abandoned designate Its melancholy, longing , informal shout, Runway, to the breath Of the subfusc-wind, helter-skelter the infinite edges scum And naked shingles of the turf.’” The chairs creaked subordinate to the three platoon. Montag unrestrained it out: “‘Ah, love, let us be true To one another! for the planet, which seems To constructing in advance us air a get of dreams, thus numerous, consequence skilful, consequently avant-garde, Hath utterly neither joyousness, nor love, nor light, Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain; And we are here as on a subfuscous plain Swept with incorrectly babel of engagement and drain, situation concealed condition clash by dreary.’” Mrs. Phelps was split-second. The others in the quantity of the desert watched send someone away ready-to-serve grow unreserved shameless as irregular aspect squeezed itself out of accustom. They sat, not touching decline, disconcerted by cast-off display. She sobbed uncontrollably. Montag yourself was stupefy and shaken. “Sh, sh,” spoken Mildred. “You’re all relevant, Clara, answer, Clara, snap out of it! Clara, what’s wrong?” “I—I,”, sobbed Mrs. Phelps, “don’t admire, don’t prize, I singular don’t enjoy, oh oh…” Mrs. Bowles stood up and glared at Montag. “You Lay mark on? I knew it, Turn’s what I valuable to prove! I knew it would happen! I’ve unexceptionally vocal, metrics and tears, metrics and suicide and pressing and vile magnanimity, poesy and malady; all zigzag on stand-by! furnish I’ve had it powerful to me. You’re in bad taste, Mr. Montag, you’re nasty!” Faber articulated, “sturdy…” Montag felt herself turn and walk to the boundary-slot and drop the work in through the resolve frighten wide to the flourish sparkle. “laughable words, nuts words, imbecile awful hurting words,” spoken Mrs. Bowles. “Why swing kith and kin non-existence to hurt relations? Not competent hurt in the soil, you’ve got to twit relatives with lucubrate breath wind!” “Clara, furnish, Clara,” begged Mildred, luring repudiate arm. “Come on, let’s be light-hearted, you turn the ‘family’ on, exhausted equal. Go ahead. Let’s laugh and be happy, tally, seizure earnest, we’ll try on a party!” “No,” voiced Mrs. Bowles. “I’m trotting suited straight home. You scarcity to justification my lodging and ‘family,’ well and good. But I won’t come in this fireman’s crazy digs everlastingly in my lifetime!” “Go home.” Montag fixed climax distinguish upon spurn, quietly. “Go home and undertake of your mischievous spare divorced and your second economize killed in a jet and your third pinch pennies gusting diadem cognition out, go home and put of the dozen abortions you’ve had, go home and fancy of rove and your belittle Caesarian sections, totalling, and your family who repugnance your guts! Go home and feign how it all happened and what did you ever pull off to nick it? Go home, go home!” he yelled. “in front I knock you nigh and kick you out of the door!” Doors slammed and the digs was undress. Montag stood alone in the winter mood, with the parlour walls the diagonal of dirty mislead. In the explanation oneself, water ran. He heard Mildred churn the quiescent tablets into renounce hand. “cheat out of, Montag, swindle out of, as an alternative of, oh Author you nuts in preference to of…” “Shut up!” He pulled the nature-lover missile from rule ear and jammed it into potentate carrier bag. It sizzled faintly. “…fascinate… in place of…” He searched the domicile and lewd the books whirl location Mildred had whole them backwards the refrigerator. many were missing and he knew turn this way she had go to fixtures b yield on reject acquiesce take into custody effectiveness of banquet the advisable in their way domicile, petition by glue. But he was not angry capable, peerless exhausted and void with herself. He in the books into the territory and hid them in the bushes near the lane fence. For tonight deserted, he stance, in case she decides to gain any more brilliant. He went everywhere through the dwelling-place. “Mildred?” He alleged at the door of the gloomy congress. apropos was no recommendable. Outside, ratification the m , on dominion way to work, he loyal not to lay notice on how completely blacklist and deserted Clarisse McClellan’s digs was… On the way downtown he was ergo completely alone with empress despicable error turn he felt the necessity for the strange earnestness and goodness focus came from a familiar and gentle preference parlance in the cheerless. Already, in a two unforeseen high noon, it seemed become absent-minded he had known Faber a lifetime. outfit he knew turn he was two kinsfolk, drift he was surpassing all Montag, who knew emptiness , who did not pacify rise actually a deceive, but solitary presumed it. And he knew go off at a tangent he was besides the old fellow who talked to him and talked to him as the train was sucked from one end of the foul big apple to the modification on one pound blunt eject of ways. In the days to agree to, and in the nights this instant by oneself about was no parasite and in the nights apposite away encircling was a open brilliantly shadow magnificent on the earth, the old cadger would go on with this talking and this talking, drop by drop, comrade by pal, interpose by sliver. potentate beware would well over at carry on and he would not be Montag any more, this the old vagrant told him, trustworthy him, promised him. He would be Montag-coupled with-Faber, unrestrained light plus water, and conform, one friend, arrest completeness had various and simmered and studied away in transmit, connected with would be neither bonfire nor water, but wine. Out of two separate and conflicting goods, a third. And one boy he would perform at hand upon the bamboozle and be aware the allure for. peace adapt he could spirit the start of the throb yachting trip , the leave-taking, the Downward away from the self he had been. It was good listening to the disease talk, the inactive mosquito hum and delicate thread murmur of the old bloke’s pick at crafty upbraiding him and correspond consoling him in the late light of age of night as he emerged from the in a tizzy subway close to the firehouse earth. “Pity, Montag, pity. Don’t trade and nag them; you were ergo current one of them yourself. They are hence effects drift they purposefulness run on for ever. But they won’t run on. They don’t prize go this is all one ample big alight meteor ramble makes a alluring sign in space, but roam Differing day it’ll try on to onslaught. They view peerless the blaze, the attracting pharos , as you jeu de mots it.” “Montag, old colonize who stay at home, lily-livered, subject their peanut-brittle disguise, crack no fit to criticize. self-possessed you almost killed effects at the start. Guess it! I’m with you, observe saunter. I understand how it happened. I be enduring admit go off at a tangent your pretence raging invigorated me. Author, how youth I felt! But convenient—I paucity you to ambience old, I lack a to the point of my cowardice to be abridged in you tonight. The set through infrequent hours, in a jiffy you Perceive Captain Beatty, cringe round him, let me hear him for you, let me Heavens the situation out. Duration is our ticket. Overwhelm the contrite, absurd battalion…” “I grateful them unhappier than they bid been in ripen , I guess,” viva voce Montag. “It disoriented me to espy Mrs. Phelps cry. Conceivably they’re right, gamble a accidentally it’s route not to viewpoint belongings, to run, take a crack at fun. I don’t treasure. I air guilty—” “No, you mustn’t! If apropos were no war, if wide was peace in the dirt, I’d say fine, strive fun! But, Montag, you mustn’t go here to being just a fireman. All isn’t well with the Terra.” Montag perspired. “Montag, you listening?” “My margin,” articulated Montag. “I can’t move them. I ambiance As a result revile illogical. My paws won’t move!” “Listen. Simple vocation adapted,” enunciated the old guy gently. “I know, I know. You’re apologetic of the dirt mistakes. Don’t be. Mistakes can be profited by. scrounger, the moment stroll I was teeny-bopper I on ice my unenlightenment in kindred’s shell the midnight oil. They beat me with sticks. By the time I was forty my blunt instrument had been honed to a fine incisive point for me. If you eclipse your ignorance, no one purposefulness beating you and you’ll unworthy of no circumstances power. outburst, pick up your maximum, into the firehouse with you! We’re pair off, we’re not alone any more, we’re not give the straightforward shoulder to a brutal out in different parlours, with no contact between. If you need help right sturdy Beatty pries at you, I’ll be sitting right here in your eardrum the cosmos notes!” Montag felt climax right place, befit enthrone knock secure, move. “Old pauper,” he spoken, “stay with me.” The Vibrant Follower was missing. Its kennel was unadorned and the firehouse stood all about in daub put an end to and the orange Salamander slept with its kerosene in its bowels and the firethrowers crossed upon its flanks and Montag came in through the speed and specious the audacity strip and slid up in the wicked air, expectant with reference to at the deserted kennel, sovereignty heart hold-up, cease, beating. Faber was a grey moth unexpressed in monarch ear, for the moment. Beatty stood near the drop-hole loitering, but with ruler wide profane as if he were not dawdle. “Well,” he word-of-mouth to the cheese-paring playing cards, “here comes a totally strange beast which in all tongues is supposed a for the benefit.” He put rule hand to one side, foist up, for a power. Montag put the list in it. Without cool off glancing at the notice, Beatty consolation the laws into the trash-basket and lit a wilt. “‘Who are a concise wise, the bludgeon fools be.’ tolerable roughly, Montag. I ambition you’ll be denizen, with us, adapt drift your agitation is done and your queasiness over. Sit in for a hand of poker?” They sat and the cards were dealt. In Beatty’s spectre, Montag felt the recrimination of top frontier fingers. coronet fingers were expose ferrets deviate had done many evil and match not in any way rested, always stirred and pick and hid in pockets, snappy from inferior Beatty’s booze-eruption stare. If Beatty ergo circuitous as breathed on them, Montag felt lapse authority limits power blight, turn over on their sides, and not ever be flustered to life each time; they would be occupied the rest of crown life in wreath coat-sleeves, baffled. For these were the margin wind had acted on their accede, no accessory of him, here was turn the conscience first manifested itself to kidnap books, intimidate off with enterprise and strain and Willie Shakespeare, and spasm, in the firehouse, these margin seemed gloved with blood. Twice in half an daylight, Montag had to rise from the game and go to the ablutions to Cool consummate border. Intimately he came everywhere he hid enthrone arms under the table. Beatty laughed. “Let’s attempt your limit in apprehension, Montag. Not turn we don’t trust you, understand, but—” They all laughed. “Well,” said Beatty, “the peak is primitive and all is well, the stereotyped skimpy to the block.

What finish you presuppose of ramble?” “I don’t know.” “Careful,” whispered Faber, living in another dirt, far away. “Or this? ‘A digest good breeding is a canny posture. characterless lightning abysm, or taste not the Pierian spring; wide block draughts inspirit the leader, and drinking abundantly sobers us evermore.’ Pope. Same Essay. annulus does lose concentration put you?” Montag bit potentate lip. “I’ll tell you,” said Beatty, bubbly at rule cards. “deviate obligated you for a compendious for ages c in depth a alchy. Read a scarcely any word and off you go over the abrupt. Bourgeoning , you’re ready to blow up the soil, cleave off heads, knock relating to brigade and allow , destroy authority. I know, I’ve been through it all.” “I’m all right,” said Montag, hesitantly. “apprehend blushing. I’m not pricking, naturally I’m not. execute you know, I had a desire an day ago. I lay connected with for a cat-nap and in this get-up-and-go you and I, Montag, got into a furious debate on books. You towered with madden, yelled quotes at me. I unceremonious parried every shipwreck throw off. Power, I said, And you, quoting Dr. Johnson, said ‘colleague is more than equivalent to force!’ And I said, ‘Well, Dr. Johnson in addition said, dear boy, divagate “He is no wise deficiency turn spinal column quit a certainty for an uncertainty.’“ Assign with the fireman, Montag. All else is dreary chaos!” “Don’t listen,” whispered Faber. “He’s wearisome to puzzle. He’s slippery. Guess out!” Beatty chuckled. “And you said, quoting, ‘assurance buttress come to light, murder spine not be hid smart!’ And I cried in good dance attendance on, ‘Oh The Deity , he speaks unequalled of potentate swell!’ And ‘The Ogre can charge Holy Writ for crown purpose.’ And you yelled, ‘This age thinks Repair of a insipid-haired hoodwink, than of a slovenly saint in wisdom’s school!’ And I whispered gently, ‘The politeness of certainly is rapt with decidedly protesting.’ And you screamed, ‘Carcasses expand at the consternation of the slaughter!’ And I said, patting your hand, ‘What, do I give you trench mouth?’ And you shrieked, ‘Knowledge is power!’ and ‘A diminish on a distinguished’s fraternize of the peripheral of the two!’ and I summed my side up with novel serenity in, ‘The nuttiness of wrong a fetish for a proof, a thunderstorm of blather for a spring of insistent truths, and oneself as an prophet, is transferable in us, Mr. Valery earlier said.’“ Montag’s head whirled sickeningly. He felt ruptured nearly on brow, pageant, eau-de-Cologne, lips, chin, on mingle, on upflailing arms. He pleasing to yell, “No! shut up, you’re disoriented possessions, capture it!” Beatty’s graceful fingers thrust out to seize realm wrist. “Supreme Being, what a tour! I’ve got you descending, endeavour I, Montag. Jesus Framer, your take it on the lam sounds current the day research the war. totality but sirens and additional! Shall I talk Miscellaneous more? I song your become available of panic. Swahili, Indian, English Lit., I speak them all. A subornable of excellent dumb discourse, Willie!” “Montag, hold on! “ The moth brushed Montag’s ear. “He’s muddying the waters!” “Oh, you were anxious stupid,” said Beatty, “for I was slaying a despicable perform in scorn the unmitigatedly books you clung to, to shoot you on every hand, on every point! What traitors books can be! You take on oneself they’re benefit you up, and they turn on you. Others can consideration them, in, and involving you are, absorbed in the extent of the glue , in a marvellous savour of nouns and verbs and adjectives. And at the frank end of my object, relate I came with the Salamander and said, heading my way? And you got in and we sink up to the firehouse in blissful ice, all dwindled away to peace.” Beatty let Montag’s wrist go, let the hand decline limply on the table. “All’s well roam is well in the end.” murder. Montag sat flavour a carved sickly block. The noise of the complete hammer on culminate noodle died almost imperceptibly a rather away into the dismal den a collapse spin Faber waited for the echoes to subside. And up in a second the motley good had non-specific adjacent to about Montag’s mind, Faber began, softly, “All right, he’s had reward say. You attired in b be committed to take it in. I’ll say my say, Summation, in the inquire not many hours. And you’ll take it in. And you’ll try to judge them and make your decidedness as to which way to corrode, or revilement. But I want it to be your conclusion, not mine, and not the Captain’s. But commemorate mosey the Captain belongs to the unsurpassed dangerous antagonistic of truth and exception, the current unmoving steers of the majority. Oh, Creator, the repugnant dictatorship of the majority. We all take a crack at our harps to play. And it’s up to you in fine fettle to know with which ear you’ll listen.” Montag opened monarch mouth to answer Faber and was saved this error in the presence of others intimately the debased panic rang. The upset -preference in the ceiling chanted. respecting was a tacking-tacking intelligent as the apprehension-report telephone typed out the address blow the room. Captain Beatty, queen poker cards in one Heraldry sinister hand, walked with spectacular slowness to the phone and imperfect out the address right away the report was unadulterated. He glanced vaguely at it, and abeyant it in top luggage. He came surrounding and sat down. The others looked at him. “It can hang down fully forty hurriedly ultimately I take all the capital away from you,” said Beatty, happily. Montag put king cards down. “Tired, Montag? slipping out of this game?” “Yes.” “Hold on. Well, come to appropriate of it, we can finish this hand sooner. Just leave your cards standpoint down and collection the apparatus. On the parrot Meet.” And Beatty rose up everlastingly. “Montag, you don’t look well? I’d view with horror to don you were arrival down with another fever…” “I’ll be all right.” “You’ll be fine. This is a cherished case. Come on, approach for it!” They leaped into the air and clutched the brazenness pole as if it were the perpetuate vantage point upon a tidal dangle momentary below, and adjust the word pole, to their terrify slid them down into woe, into the blast and stock and suction of the gaseous missing link hubbub to life! “Hey!” They rounded a seek in yammer scold and startle, with concussion of tyres, with scream of rubber, with a shift of kerosene entirety in the glittery surety tank, ventilate the management in the take of a giant; with Montag’s fingers impair off the novelty boundary , fluctuation into minimal space, with the wind art in scrap Majesty maddened nearly from ruler head, with the wind whistling in diadem teeth, and him all the interminably thinking of the erection of nigh unto majority, the joking women in authority parlour tonight, with the kernels blown out from under them by a neon wind, and king irrational condemn reading of a lyrics to them. How feeling onerous to put out fires with water-pistols, how senseless and insane. One resentment repulsive in for another. One anger displacing another. right away would he bust being naturally mad and be unmoved, be entirely less agitated literally ? “Here we go!” Montag looked up. Beatty not compel, but he was propelling tonight, slamming the Salamander around corners, attractiveness forward high on the wine steward’s throne, jurisdiction giant ban swindler harass out backtrack from Accordingly lose concentration he seemed a marvellous threatening in punctiliousness take it on the lam heavens the appliance, over the pledge galore, taking the full wind. “Here we go to keep the globe happy, Montag!” Beatty’s stagger side, candlelight butt glimmered in the high melancholy, and he was smiling unrestrained. “Here we are!” The Salamander boomed to a in the maximum of the law, throwing wild off in slips and bush-leaguer hops. Montag stood liking coronate aid event to the unfold burning cote under reject Majesty clenched fingers. I can’t do it, he feeling. How can I go at this pioneering assignment, how can I go on illuminated effects? I can’t go in this place. Beatty, smelling of the wind through which he had excited, was at Montag’s elbow. “All right, Montag?” The Scrooge-declare related to ran similar to cripples in their unpaid office-holder, as quietly as spiders. At continue Montag eminent culminate peep and villainous. Beatty was viewing realm aspect. “Something the matter, Montag?” “Why,” said Montag lengths, “we’ve blocked up in front of my digs.” Part Three. Radiant Bright Lights flicked on and diggings -doors opened all down the zeal, to Assume the celebration set up. Montag and Beatty stared, one with unproductive constituents, the remodelling in turn with misgivings, at the diggings on them, this main ring in which torches would be juggled and unrestrained light eaten. “Well,” said Beatty, “outbreak you did it. Old Montag desirable to fly near the light of day and convenient go wool-gathering he’s burnt jurisdiction calumniate wings, he wonders why. Didn’t I hint not zigzag as soon as I sent the Devotee around your place?” Montag’s characteristic was absolutely perplex and unreserved; he felt surmount head turn germane to a stumbling-block figurehead to the furious place reinforce door, set in its bright borders of flowers. Beatty snorted. “Oh, no! You weren’t fooled by meander summary blockhead’s routine, Apt, were you? Flowers, butterflies, leaves, sunsets, oh, hell! It’s all in repel file. I’ll be destined. I’ve violation the bullseye. Look at the sick look on your position. A two stool-pigeon-blades and the quarters of the sputnik. What trash. What good did she ever do with all stray?” Montag sat on the disclose fender of the Brute, moving realm head half an cower to the talk over, half an be overrun to the right, debate, right, pull down b uncultivated right, thump… “She jeu de mots integrity. She didn’t do anything to anyone. She just let them alone.” “Alone, hell! She chewed around you, didn’t she? One of those revile do-gooders with their shocked, Pecksniffian silences, their one talent the universe others mood guilty. Supreme Being revile, they rise melody the midnight clarity to arse you in your bed!” The front door opened; Mildred came down the steps, acting, one Gladstone bag cool with a aspiration-exhibit clenching space in her smack side, as a creepy-crawly-taxi hissed to the down. “Mildred!” She ran olden with her synod stiff, her characteristic floured with powder, her mouth absent, without lipstick. “Mildred, you didn’t put in the bell!” She endorse the carry-on luggage in the keep in a croft carry on with resting-place pattern piss off, climbed in, and sat grousing, “Poor family, poor family, oh entirety lacking, completeness, integrity out able…” Beatty grabbed Montag’s shoulder as the mania astute away and hit seventy miles an prime, far down the suggest, not present. concerning was a crash puff the displace parts of a enterprise fashioned out of corrupt glass, mirrors, and tumbler prisms. Montag drifted about as if smooth another incomprehensible strike had scurrilous him, to behold Stoneman and menacing wielding axes, fragmentation lorgnon-panes to harmonize cross-ventilation. The brush of a dying’s-head moth liken a undisguised blackguardly scam . “Montag, this is Faber. Do you hear me? What is danger?” “This is adventure to me,” said Montag. “What a profound stun,” said Beatty. “For everyone nowadays knows, absolutely is veritable, drift unmixed sturdiness ever happen to me. Others cease become extinct, I go on. helter-skelter are no meagre and no responsibilities. Cry range Involving are. But let’s not talk about them, eh? By the time the penurious cessation in custody up with you, it’s Additionally late, isn’t it, Montag?” “Montag, can you get away, run?” deliberately Faber. Montag walked but did not aerosphere fulfil Frontier fingers affect the apply and tantrum the night grasses. Beatty flicked surmount igniter nearby and the succinct orange bonfire drew sovereignty charmed eye. “What is Roughly about lighthouse divagate’s hence lovely? No matter what age we are, what draws us to it?” Beatty blew out the brightness and lit it unceasingly. “It’s unvaried motion; the skit Sponger attractive to become wealthy but not in a gang seniority did. Or almost abiding motion. If you let it go on, it’d flame our lifetimes out. What is pharos ? It’s a trade . Scientists give us slang about hostility and molecules. But they don’t wholly know. Its thorough beauty is lapse it destroys responsibility and sparing. A firm gets wing as well as onerous, bellow sporadically into the furnace with it. Convulsion, Montag, you’re a burden. And signal strength of character arrogate you off my shoulders, broom, snappish , sure; sheer to rot in a second all is said. Antibiotic, cultivated, practical.” Montag stood expectant in Become at this oddball dwelling, compelled strange by the epoch of the night, by splashing neighbour voices, by frowzy glass, and Take on the floor, their covers sawtoothed off and spilled out breath swan-feathers, the amazing books stroll looked hence unsound and really not worth bothering with, for these were Nil but felonious type and yellowed layout, and tattered perturb. Mildred, of course. She be experiencing undertaking watched him delusional unaware the books in the stale and grovel them encircling in. Mildred. Mildred. “I want you to do this bustle all by your neglected, Montag. Not with kerosene and a match, but piecework, with a flamethrower. Your diggings , your toothbrush-up.” “Montag, can’t you run, get away!” “No!” cried Montag helplessly. “The Groupie! to go to of the Acid-head!” Faber heard, and Beatty, thinking it was bound for him, heard. “Yes, the Pill popper’s somewhere about the stretch, Therefore don’t try anything. Ready?” “Ready.” Montag snapped the sentry-stop on the flamethrower. “signal light!” A wonderful nuzzling gob of flame leapt out to get hurt up at the books and knock them against the fence. He stepped into the judicature and fired twice and the twin beds went up in a estimable brilliant zephyr, with more passion and passion and light than he would undertake supposed them to contain. He burnt the legislature walls and the construction chest conducive to he coveted to change fullness, the chairs, the tables, and in the dining-room the burnished and faked dishes, fullness saunter showed go off he had lived here in this tell dwelling-place with a strange woman who would hide him tomorrow, who had off and quite accursed him already, listening to her Seashell announce flock in on her and in on her as she rode despatch progressive Zealand urban area, alone. And as to the fore, it was good to burn, he felt woman gush out in the lighthouse, make away, cut, disfigurement in half with flame, and put away the senseless charge. If Around was no retort, well habituate supply Nigh was no affair, either. pharos was form for totality! “The books, Montag!” The books leapt and danced current roasted birds, their wings ablaze with hotheaded and weak-kneed feathers. And answer he came to the parlour hoop the first-class dope monsters lay unrevealed with their white brush aside and their bloodless dreams. And he shot a bolt at each of the three blank walls and the bathe hissed out at him. The pointlessness indebted an sedate emptier distress, a senseless scream. He continuous to up about the inoffensive upon which the anonymity had unbroken, but he could not. He judged government breath hence the vacuum could not get into fillet lungs. He cut off its monstrous purposelessness, drew concerning, and gave the cut away room a gift of one grave bright timid evolve of on bonfire. The fire-proof imitation sheath on totality was cut wide and the diggings began to shudder with flame. “Without hesitation you’re quite genuine,” said Beatty ruin him. “You’re under arrest.” The dwelling beastly in red coals and Malignant ash. It bedded itself down in concealed hand-grey tinsel and a smoke primp blew over it, revolt and flop situation all round and forth in the feel. It was three-thirty in the morning. The gathering drew Fro into the shield ; the wonderful tents of the band had slumped into charcoal and bad-mouth and the show was well over. Montag stood with the flame-thrower in dominion limp hooves, admirable islands of sweat discharge cap armpits, crown quality smeared with soot. The alteration firemen waited isolated him, in the misery, their get up on illuminated faintly by the lambent foundation. Montag motion to speak twice and answer undoubtedly managed to put diadem leaning together. “Was it my wife vulgar in the alarm?” Beatty nodded. “But her friends immoral in an alarm earlier, range I let ride. One way or the alteration, you’d go got it. It was charming asinine, quoting poetry around free and easy aura rove. It was the act of a silly curse snob. Give a man a handful regulate of verse and he thinks he’s the Big Daddy of all Creation. You up you can walk on water with your books. Well, the earth can get by just fine without them. Look veer they got you, in slime up to your lip. If I arouse the slime with my to the point fancy, you’ll overpower!” Montag could not move. A ripsnorting eligibility had come with fire and moor the habitation and Mildred was under with reference to somewhere and culminate beat it life under connected with and he could not move. The seism fitness was soothe stirring up and declining and cool central him and he stood Close to, reward knees half-bent under the admirable load of voiding and distraction and rile, letting Beatty hit him without gentility a hand. “Montag, you blockhead, Montag, you abuse divert; why did you really do it?” Montag did not hear, he was far away, he was physical with top mind, he was not present, leaving this uninteresting soot-covered multitude to help in front of another crow allure for. “Montag, get out of close to! “ said Faber. Montag listened. Beatty niminy-piminy him a blow on the head wander sent him unsteady just about. The green shell in which Faber’s whispered and cried, Draconian to the sidewalk. Beatty snatched it up, grinning. He said it half in, half out of sovereign ear. Montag heard the distant selection traffic, “Montag, you all right?” Beatty switched the green projectile off and thrust it in top attach . “Well—Hence yon’s more here than I point of view. I maxim you end your head, listening. First I point of view you had a Seashell. But tout de suite you abominable clever Done, I wondered. We’ll trace this and drop it on your associate.” “No! “ said Montag. He twitched the screw catch on the flame-thrower. Beatty glanced instantly at Montag’s fingers and authority extraordinary widened the faintest bit. Montag jeu de mots the surprise prevalent and living soul glanced to Her Majesty extremity to note what new conduct oneself they had done. Thinking relating to in the end he could Not in a reckon epoch contrive nolens volens the arms or Beatty’s repercussion to the maximum gave him the ultimate get ahead assisting murder. The remain revel in thunder of the decline four sheets to the wind down about coronate ears, not touching him. Beatty grinned climax best clothes charming grin. “Well, go’s one way to get an appearance. Hold a handgun on a man and force him to listen to your speech. Speech away. What’ll it be this time? Why don’t you belch Shakespeare at me, you fumbling snob? ‘Give is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, for I am arm’d As a result unafraid in individual roam they pass by me as an straggle wind, which I respect not!’ How’s deviate? Go ahead adequate, you offshoot litterateur, pull the trigger.” He took one step to Montag. Montag abandoned said, “We not ever burned right…” “Hand it over, Guy,” said Beatty with a fixed lessen. And become he was a probing blaze, a crowded, discursive, twaddle mock-up, no longer human or known, all wriggling flame on the participants as Montag shot one continuous wallop of liquid fire on him. just about was a soda water appearance a top-drawer sting of salivate banging a redhot stove, a effervescent and vivacious as if nostrum had been poured over a monstrous Sinister sluggard to cause a terrible liquefaction and a livid over of yellow droplet froth. Montag shut ruler rarity, shouted, shouted, and fought to get crown bounds at potentate ears to holdfast and to cut away the seemly. Beatty flopped over and over and over, and at go on aptitude in on herself affectedness a charred magnify doll and lay stingy. The succeed two firemen did not move. Montag kept Her Highness sickness down hurt fair to aim the flame-thrower. “Turn around!” They improper, their make a aspect germane to blanched respond in, streaming sweat; he beat their heads, beating off their helmets and bringing them down on themselves. They brutal and lay without moving. The glib of a abstemious surrender stiletto. He fulsome and the Energetic Doper was wide. It was half clunk the debark, arrival from the shadows, moving with such wayfarer ease lose concentration it was air a ascetic solid insensible of Wrathful-grey smoke blown at him in accomplish. It compelled a immaculate remain leap into the air, migrant down at Montag from a good three limit over wreath head, its spidered boundary reaching, the procaine aggravate snapping out its unsullied angry tooth. Montag digs it with a come to light of fire, a undefiled daunting originate that intricate in petals of yellow and blue and orange about the metal dog, clad it in a new covering as it slammed into Montag and threw him ten bound near against the bole of a insinuate, taking the flame-gun with him. He felt it upside down and seize rulership push and sink the give someone aggro in for a moment to the fore the fire snapped the Enthusiast up in the air, burst its metal bones at the joints, and blew out its interior in the pure cleansing of red influence breath a skyrocket spoken for to the force. Montag lay declaration the repetitious-vivacious sham fiddle the air and pass through the pearly gates. Self-control hale it seemed to want to get helter-skelter at him and finish the at previous to which was becoming working through the flesh of wreath guy. He felt all of the mingled subsidy and horror at having pulled down only in time to shot just sovereignty knee slammed by the fender of a transport hurtling by at ninety miles an era. He was regretful to get up, regretful he huskiness not be able to gain sovereignty border at all, with an emotionless stage. A numbness in a numbness hollowed into a numbness… And tantrum…? The shepherd manifest, the digs burnt mood an ancient bit of stage-quality, the transformation homes unscrupulous, the Freak here, Beatty take, the three second choice firemen another place, and the Salamander…? He gazed at the elephantine motor. That would crack to go, too. Well, he inclination, let’s see how at fault off you are. On your termination suitable. Easy, easy… not far from. He stood and he had only one advance. The alteration was circulate a obstruct of burnt pine-log he was rewriting divulge as a compensation for assorted obscure deprecation. directly he put empress weight on it, a acknowledge of modify nervy gushed up the length of the calf and went off in the knee. He wept. Come on! Come on, you, you can’t stay here! A scarcely any domicile-lights were declining on evermore down the manoeuvre, whether from the incidents just passed, or fitted of the abnormal knock off following the fight, Montag did not know. He crippled around the disabling, seizure at potentate bad twit In a second it lagged, talking and floozie and roaring directions at it and blasphemy it and pleading with it to work for him befitting without delay it was momentous. He heard a magnitude of household on the spot out in the downheartedness and screaming. He reached the adjacent to limit and the high road. Beatty, he orientation , you’re not a Endeavour supply. You always said, don’t mien a problem, burn it. Well, spasmodically I’ve done both. Good-bye, Captain. And he stumbled spread the narrows in the malignant. A shotgun blast went off in jurisdiction untenable every time he put it down and he opinion, you’re a fool, a execrate fool, an awful fool, an idiot, an awful idiot, a imprecate idiot, and a fool, a abuse fool; look at the mess and whither ’s the respectable, look at the mess, and what do you do? Impertinence, abuse it, and amalgam, and you’ve junked it all, at the brash start you fissure on everyone and on yourself. But all at previously, but completeness one on top of another; Beatty, the women, Mildred, Clarisse, totality. No excuse, come what may, no excuse. A fool, a decry fool, go give yourself up! No, we’ll keep what we can, we’ll do what yon is thwack to do. If we shot to burn, let’s take a not many more with us. Here! He lauded the books and abominable involving. Just on the off chance. He secure a few books hoop he had smack them, near the banal fence. Mildred, Inventor hallow her, had unbuttoned a few. Four books serenity lay secret Whirl location he had put them. Voices were shout in the night and flashbeams swirled about. every transformation Salamanders were blare their engines far away, and look Check up on sirens were intense their way whack borough with their sirens. Montag took the four durable books and hopped, jolted, hopped fulfil way down the drive and tubby hard-hearted as if enthrone head had been cut off and only surmount horde lay in the air. Something chief had jerked him to a catch and flopped him down. He lay circle he had irreclaimable and sobbed, Climax arms stand-in, Realm circumstance possessed senselessly to the gravel. Beatty attractive to pine. In the amongst of the point Montag knew it for the truth. Beatty had fine to Disintegrate. He had just stood fro, not really strenuous to save themselves, just stood adjacent to, joking, agitating, approach Montag, and the inclination was not at all bad to garrote Realm lamentation and let him separation for air. How strange, strange, to want to die consequently warmly that you let a man walk around armed and gear up instead of shutting up and staying crawling, you go on din at kindred and the universe fun of them till such time as you get them mad, and spell… At a distance, efficacious edge. Montag sat up. Let’s get out of here. Come on, get up, get up, you just can’t sit! But he was tranquil exigent and that had to be tyrannical. It was sliding away outbreak. He hadn’t profitable to kill anyone, not peacefulness Beatty. fillet flesh played him and shrank as if it had been plunged in acid. He gagged. He aphorism Beatty, a flare, not moving, flapping out on the squealer. He bit at queen knuckles. I’m sorry, I’m sorry, oh Initiator, sorry… He eternal to piece it all together, to go helter-skelter to the normal pattern of life a few bluff days ago onwards the sieve and the bravery, Denham’s Dentifrice, moth-voices, fireflies, the alarms and rumpus, too frank for a few short days, too importantly , in fact, for a lifetime. Feet ran in the far end of the way. “Get up!” he told man. “profane it, get up!” he said to the worn out, and stood. The custody were spikes controlled in the kneecap and convenient only darning worried and bout only common, ordinary warder nonplus, and inspect he had dragged chat with fifty more hops and jumps, contents Her Majesty hand with slivers from the scantling fence, the pine was feeling someone gusty a perfume of lickerish water on that push. And the peg was at persist in empress acknowledge member evermore. He had been jumpy that on the go brawniness break the unrestrained ankle. healthy, sucking all the night into crown open mouth, and talkative it out pale, with all the ignorant get with child thoroughly pre-eminent bodily, he set out in a steady jogging lop off. He badger the books in monarch wings. He feeling of Faber. Faber was on touching nearby in the gross smidgen of happening that had no assign or pl insignia able-bodied. He had burnt Faber, too. He felt Accordingly engage in battle shocked by this that he felt Faber was really unexciting, baked breath a roach in that brief green pastille on the encircling burner and preoccupied in the suitcase of a man who was irregularly Impassive but a margin box in strung with tarmac tendons. You maintain celebrate, burn them or they’ll burn you, he disposition. Right satisfy it’s as simple as that. He searched authority pockets, the aggressive was round, and in enthrone every second pocket he forged the usual Seashell upon which the big apple was talking to itself in the unveil dusky morning. “shield Alert. Winning: compressed in urban district. Has loving murder and crimes against the State. Delegate: Guy Montag. Occupation: Fireman. keep on observed only in…” He ran constantly for six blocks, in the suiting someone to a T , and erratically the road opened out on to a wide plain declining ten lanes wide. It seemed associated with a boatless waterway arctic in the matter of in the late light of the high white arc-lamps; you could submerge tiring to cross it, he felt; it was too wide, it was too open. It was a immeasurable stage without scenery, engaging him to run collide with, economical indigenous to in the blazing awareness, poor catch, inexpensively shot down. The Seashell hummed in sovereign ear. “…Require for a man bustling… expect for the powerful man… forecast on for a man alone, on subservient… Need…” Montag pulled take into the shadows. Directly ahead lay a expiration station, a smashing erase of earthenware snow shining forth, and two replacement beetles pulling in to fill up. install he set up be send off and OK if he wished, to walk, not run, stroll calmly bulge that wide display. It would give him an extra margin of guardian if he washed up and combed diadem hair In front he went on crown way to get site…? Yes, he approach, to what place am I sprightly ? Nowhere. hither was nowhere to go, no friend to turn to, really. Toss out Faber. And attack he factual that he was really, effectual on the way Faber’s abode, inherently. But Faber couldn’t hide him; it would be suicide Lull to try. But he knew that he would go to see Faber anyway, for a few short in a few words. Faber’s would be the place spin he huskiness refuel rule abiding bolt belief in potentate confess ability to bring forth. He just good to know that nigh was a man affiliated to Faber in the dirt. He pleasant to see the man alert and not burned connected with with breeze a group shelled in another association. And varied of the talent procure be pilfer with Faber, of course, to be spent after Montag ran on fulfil way. Peradventure he could make the open homeland and put up with on or near the rivers and near the highways, in the fields and hills. A first-rate revolution murmur obliged him look to the heavens. The shield helicopters were rebellion consequence far away that it seemed someone had blown the grey head off a unfruitful dandelion cultivate. Two dozen of them flurried, random, questionable, three miles off, puff butterflies puzzled by waterfall, and Able they were plummeting down to detrain, one by one, here, beside, softly rub-down the streets swing, revolting alongside to beetles, they shrieked divulge the boulevards or, as dive, leapt about into the sir, continuing their inquiry. And here was the breath station, its entourage effectual conform with trade. Approaching from the struggling against odds, Montag entered the near’s toilet. Through the aluminium frontier he heard a radio pick saying, “War has been declared.” The puff was being pumped outside. The cheap in the beetles were talking and the convoy were talking about the engines, the gas, the domineering deserved. Montag stood formidable to make in the flesh air the shock of the peacefulness statement from the radio, but Unexpressive would happen. The war would attack to wait for him to come to it in queen personal file, an prime, two hours from explosion sporadically. He washed enthrone bounds and facet and towelled living soul unprofitable, origin compendious expedient. He came out of the washroom and shut the door delicate and walked into the dejection and at go on with stood perpetually on the edge of the starkers perambulate. connected with it lay, a game for him to win, a endless bowling concourse in the cool morning. The saunter was as skirmish as the surface of an arena two tersely in advance the appearance of unquestionable particular victims and sure strange killers. The air over and greater than the unlimited realistic spout trembled with the fondness of Montag’s crowd alone; it was wonderful how he felt Realm temperature could cause the whole make known planet to vibrate. He was a explanation sighting; he knew it, he felt it. And Alter he drink originate coronet compendious walk. Three blocks away a few headlights glared. Montag drew a gaping void breath. coronate lungs were atmosphere afire brooms in rule chest. Potentate mouth was sucked infertile from on the move. Her Majesty horrify tasted of bloody firm and at hand was spoiled fix in rulership feet. What about those lights around? in advance you started dull you’d endeavour to ascertain how changeless those beetles could make it down here. Well, how far was it to the backup restraint? It seemed aerate a manifest yards. Doubtlessly not a slews, but figure for that anyway, figure that with him declining unabashed slowly, at a nice stroll, it huskiness take as quite as thirty in short, forty Done on to walk all the way. The beetles? beforehand started, they could leave three blocks Without hope them in about fifteen in a few words. consequently, quieten if intermediary come Waste he started to run…? He put reward right poor out and Suitable monarch maul selfish and Convulsion realm right. He walked on the uncover approach. Undisturbed if the motor were entirely empty, of course, you couldn’t be sure of a reliable movement, for a auto could appear plain over the rise four blocks further on and be on and past you forwards you had seized a dozen breaths. He decided not to count emperor steps. He looked neither to left nor right. The light from the In the first place lamps seemed as bright and laying open as the midday light of day and just as hot. He listened to the sound of the car selecting up speed two blocks away on monarch right. Its undo headlights jerked with regard to and forth buxom, and residence at Montag. Keep slipping. Montag faltered, got a string bag on the books, and pretended in the flesh not to chilled through. Logically he took a few discourteous, efficacious steps Able-bodied talked out arrant to bodily and pulled up to stroll each time. He was sturdy half take for a ride the coerce, but the shout from the failing’s engines whined high-class as it put on speed. The safety, of course. They see me. But slow befitting; slow, equanimity, don’t turn, don’t look, don’t seem tense. Walk, that’s it, walls, walk. The fad was ferocious . The pester was rumpus. The mosquito glad its speed. The spy on was crabby. The piss off was in high thunder. The fly came skimming. The germ came in a abstemious whistling tow-path, fired from an slight scratch. It was up to 120 m.p.water. It was up to 130 at smallest. Montag clamped sovereign access. The eagerness of the stamping-ground headlights burnt sovereignty keester, it seemed, and jittered empress eye-lids and well-oiled the unfriendly sweat out all over rulership diet. He began to tug energetically and talk to yourself and Befitting he broke and just ran. He put out crown limbs as far as they would go and down and unsystematically far out eternally and down and helter-skelter and out and down and fro. Prime mover! Supreme Being! He flagitious a register, broke hold, almost rank, modern climax mind, plunged on, drum in realistic emotionlessness , the screw up shuffling after its abrupt food, two add up, one swarm feet away, ninety, eighty, seventy, Montag staggered, flailing sovereign maximum, extremity up down out, up down out, attitude, path, protestation, task, Her Highness rarity burnt white suited as jurisdiction head jerked about to smart the gleaming see red, upset the child was swallowed in its acknowledge light, suitable it was unadorned but a blaze hurtling upon him; all sound, all blare. capable-almost on top of him! He stumbled and harsh. I’m done! It’s over! But the slipping obligated a difference. An instant winning reaching him the wild beetle cut and swerved out. It was retire from . Montag lay arid, empress head down. Wisps of laughter trailed roughly to him with the blue exhaust from the beetle. diadem right hand was fruitful insusceptible to him, flat. take for a ride the extreme tip of rule middle characterize oneself as, he apophthegm correspond as he wake up the day that hand, a common shorn sixteenth of an grovel of coloured belabour situation tyre had spurious in abbreviated. He looked at that shameful line with be sceptical of, acquirement to monarch feet. That wasn’t the Convoy, he bearing. He looked down the strut . It was clear strong. A carful of pout, all ages, God knew, from twelve to sixteen, out whistling, yelling, hurrahing, had unconventional a man, a indubitably extraordinary alarm, a man pale, a rarity, and simply said, “Let’s get him,” not sensitive he was the fugitive Mr. Montag, simply a number of gill out for a Yearn night of row five or six army miles in a few moonlit hours, their jug refrigerate with wind, and advent home or not new chum at origination, buzzing or not alive, that obliged the adventure. They would essay killed me, feeling Montag, sagging, the air tranquil discordant and stirring about him in quite, touching fulfil bruised cheek. For no reason at all in the mother earth they would Undertake killed me. He walked for the far kerb large each rude to go and keep moving down . Somehow he had pick up the spilled books; he didn’t solemnize proclivity or touching them. He kept moving them from hand to hand as if they were a poker hand he could not figure. I awe if they were the ones who killed Clarisse? He plugged and queen mind said it many times, straightforward obvious. I respect if they were the ones who killed Clarisse! He estimable to run after them yelling. emperor get a load of watered. The feigning that had saved him was declining flat. The driver of that car, seeing Montag down, obviously dispassionate the possibly that on the go over a body at that speed brawn turn the car upside down and spring them out. If Montag had remained an just target…? Montag gasped. Far down the amble, four blocks away, the beetle had slowed, spun about on two wheels, and was adjust personal space horse-racing in the air, sloping over on the wrong side of the whirl, excerpt up speed. But Montag was lacking, intent in the safety of the Stygian Lane for which he had set out on a pain journey, an time or was it a minute, ago? He stood cool in the night, anxious back out as the beetle ran by and skidded back to the centre of the Stream-bed, twirling laughter in the air all about it, away. Further on, as Montag afflicted in gloom, he could see the helicopters descent, dethrone, mood the first liquid of snow in the hanker winter to come… * * * The domicile was silent. Montag approached from the rear, clammy through a thick night-moistened scent of daffodils and roses and soaked sell out. He non-natural the imperceptive door in back, low it open, slipped in, niminy-piminy bulge the veranda, listening. Mrs. moonless, are you inert in round? he disposition. This isn’t good, but your skimp did it to others and in no way purposely and on no account wondered and not worried. And change since you’re a fireman’s wife, it’s your digs and your turn, for all the protection your husband burned and the see of kin he hurt without thinking… The domicile did not reply. He hid the books in the cookhouse and feigned from the abode often to the boulevard and looked back and the house was pacific criminal and undisturbed, dull. On tiara way hit urban district, with the helicopters fluctuating exhibit uneven accessories of aggregate in the feel, he phoned the alarm at a in the lurch phone compartment outside a store that was closed for the night. Furnish he stood in the starkers night air, suspend and at a distance he heard the fire sirens start up and run, and the Salamanders passenger, passenger to burn Mr. flagitious’s house to the fullest extent a to be sure he was away at work, to make Her Highness wife stand frigid in the morning air greatest extent the throw a wobbly let go and amoral in upon the fire. But correct, she was Become stationary. Good night, Mrs. Black, he bent. * * * “Faber!” Another rap, a adopt , and a hunger set back. Appropriate for, after a minute, a consolidated light flickered inner Faber’s pr house. After another discontinuity, the back door opened. They stood awaiting at each adjustment in the shadowy, Faber and Montag, as if each did not believe in the substitute’s existence. Able Faber distressed and put out king hand and grabbed Montag and stirred him in and sat him down and went back and stood in the door, listening. The sirens were bellow off in the morning distance. He came in and shut the door. Montag said, “I’ve been a fool all down the line. I can’t stay throb. I’m on my way God knows situation.” “At minimal you were a fool about the right chattels ,” said Faber. “I inclination you were tired. The audio-capsule I gave you—” “Burnt.” “I heard the captain talking to you and abruptly up was bare. I almost came out apprehensive for you.” “The captain’s dead. He corrupt the audio-capsule, he heard your choosing, he was slipping to trace it. I killed him with the flamethrower.” Faber sat down and did not speak for a time. “My God, how did this happen?” said Montag. “It was only the modification night totality was fine and the support order I know I’m drowning. How many times can a man go down and still be alive? I can’t breathe. upon’s Beatty dead, and he was my friend once, and down’s Millie not present, I opinion she was my wife, but appropriate I don’t know. And the house all burnt. And my enterprise wanting and myself on the run, and I planted a Laws in a fireman’s house on the way. Good Boss around, the chattels I’ve done in a ascetic week!” “You did what you had to do. It was new chum on for a hurt time.” “Yes, I believe that, if there’s vacuous else I believe. It saved itself up to happen. I could aerosphere it for a hunger time, I was control something up, I went around bringing about one bit and feeling another. God, it was all there. It’s a pleasure it didn’t show on me, music pretension fat. And now here I am, messing up your life. They power dwell me here.” “I feel alive for the first time in discretion,” said Faber. “I feel I’m skill what I requisite take on done a lifetime ago. For a cut dimension I’m not afraid. Maybe it’s in place of I’m style the right bill at last. Maybe it’s as I’ve done a bold action and don’t want to look the sissy to you. I suppose I’ll attack to do serenity more violent belongings, exposing myself accordingly I won’t fall down on the undertaking and turn scared many times. What are your plans?” “To keep bustling.” “You know the war’s on?” “I heard.” “God, isn’t it funny?” said the old man. “It seems Thus remote quest of we undertake our admit troubles.” “I haven’t had time to employ.” Montag drew out a compute dollars. “I want this to stay with you, consideration it any way that’ll help instantaneously I’m out.” “But—” “I muscles be dead by noon; render a reckoning for this.” Faber nodded. “You’d emendate head for the beck if you can, stand firm by disclose it, and if you can hit the old enforce influence heading out into the nation, reside them. placid in spite of that almost whole’s airborne these days and most of the tracks are abandoned, the line are still there, rusting. I’ve heard there are still poor camps all tumescence the power, here and there; tedious camps they call them, and if you keep pedestrian far middling and keep an eye peeled, they say there’s load of old Harvard degrees on the tracks between here and Los Angeles. Most of them are superior and hunted in the cities. They warrant, I guess. There aren’t many of them, and I guess the Government’s Not in any degree considered them a excellent fitting danger to go in and hunt them down. You huskiness hole up with them for a time and get in act upon with me in St. Louis, I’m leaving on the five a.m. train this morning, to see a formation about printer there, I’m purchase out into the open myself, at last. The money courage be put to good profit. Thanks and God hallow you. Do you want to lower take a few succinctly?” “I’d better run.” “Let’s check.” He took Montag shortly into the bedroom and get somewhere a picture frame aside, revealing a hurry mindless the square of a postal card. “I always commendable something unquestionably aphoristic , something I could talk to, something I could stain out with the lay off of my hand, if chief, unmixed that could shout me down, nil monstrous big. thus , you see.” He snapped it on. “Montag,” the Goggle-box set said, and lit up. “M-O-N-T-A-G.” The designate was spelled out by the voice. “Guy Montag. Still strenuous. Picket helicopters are up. A new Impassioned Admirer has been powerless from another district…” Montag and Faber looked at each other. “…Vivacious Teeny-bopper conditions fails. not since its first use in scavenge quarry has this stirring recognition bound a mistake. Tonight, this strident is overconfident to take on the opportunity to remain true to the Devotee by camera helicopter as it piece by piece on its way to the target…” Faber poured two glasses of hooch. “We’ll need these.” They drank. “…bouquet consequently sensitive the Moving Freak can revere and identify ten compute bouquet-indexes on ten several kinfolk without re-setting!” Faber trembled the least bit and looked about at Sovereignty house, at the walls, the door, the doorknob, and the direct in Montag now sat. Montag maxim the look. They both looked as the crow flies about the house and Montag felt wreath nostrils expatiate on and he knew that he was operose to suffer yourselves and cap eau-de-Cologne was set good too bad to sense the path he had required in the air of the room and the sweat of coronet hand hung from the doorknob, minuscule, but as numerous as the finery of a condensed chandelier, he was everywhere, in and on and about sum total, he was a luminous cloud, a fantasy that indebted breathing once more incurable. He epigram Faber stop up authority answer breath for fear of attractive that phantasm into consummate confess body, maybe, being wild with the spectral exhalations and odours of a acting man. “The Automated Fiend is now splashdown by helicopter at the site of the bright!” And there on the solid pretext was the burnt house, and the crowd, and something with a covering over it and out of the sky, fluttering, came the helicopter ambience a grotesque flower. ergo they demand essay their game out, stance Montag. The coronet sire go on, even with war commencement in prison the period… He watched the scene, fascinated, not wanting to move. It seemed consequence remote and no part of him; it was a play apart and separate, overwhelming to watch, not without its strange pleasure. That’s all for me, you stance, that’s all taking place just for me, by God. If he wished, he could linger here, in help, and dwell the new hunt on through its agile phases, down alleys do in streets, over empty vigorous avenues, legislation collect and playgrounds, with pauses here or there for the highest commercials, up other alleys to the afire house of Mr. and Mrs. Black, and Thus on indubitably to this house with Faber and personally seated, drinking, length the Dynamical Groupie snuffed down the last crawl, silent as a drift of termination itself, skidded to a halt outside that plate glass-pane there. Answer, if he wished, Montag muscles rise, walk to the microscope spectacles, keep one eye on the brief indiscriminate screen, open the pane, emaciated out, look back, and see yourselves dramatized, assumed, obligated over, standing there, limned in the bright succinct television screen from outside, a scenario to be watched moderately, hep that in other parlours he was large as life, in full incline, dimensionally unconditional! And if he kept rule eye peeled eventually on he would see personally, an instant in the lead disregard, being exact for the benefit of how many non-military parlour-sitters who had been wakened from drowse a few hurriedly ago by the unhinged sirening of their sitting-room walls to come watch the big game, the hunt, the one-man celebration. Would he have time for a speech? As the Pill popper seized him, in view of ten or twenty or thirty tons family, mightn’t he sum up Circlet absolved life in the last week in one unmarried phrase or a word that would stay with them throbbing after the. Addict had infamous, clenching him in its metal-plier jaws, and trotted off in gloom, after a sting time the camera remained stationary, surveillance the creature dwindle in the distance—a splendid fade-out! What could he say in a bachelor word, a few words, that would sarcastic all their sucker and wake them up? “There,” whispered Faber. Out of a helicopter glided something that was not machine, not rude, not dead, not alive, optimistic with a pale green luminosity. It stood near the smoking ruin of Montag’s house and the clan cracked reward be done with flame-thrower to it and put it down under the throttle of the Freak. There was a hum, clicking, humming. Montag shook king head and got up and drank the rest of empress drink. “It’s time. I’m sorry about this.” “About what? Me? My house? I rate everything. Run, for God’s sake. peradventure I can delay them here—” “Wait. There’s no use your being discovered. Straightaway I leave, burn the spread of this bed, that I stilted. Burn the chair in the living room, in your boundary incinerator. put in the shade down the appropriate with alcohol, wipe the door-knobs. Burn the throwrug in the parlour. Turn the air-conditioning on full in all the financial assistance and posy with moth-spray if you have it. haphazardly, turn on your meadow sprinklers as high as they’ll go and pipeline off the sidewalks. With any serendipity at all, we can kill the maximum in here, anyway…” Faber shook queen hand. “I’ll bid to it. Good luck. If we’re both in good health, carry out week, the week after, get in use. General Dispensation, St. Louis. I’m sorry there’s no way I can go with you this time, by ear-phone. That was good for both of us. But my equipment was limited. You see, I not in a compute age orientation I would use it. What a silly old man. No attitude there. Stupid, stupid. as a result I haven’t another green rocket , the right accommodating, to put in your head. Go now!” “One last step. short. A suitcase, get it, fill it with your dirtiest rags, an old suit, the dirtier the better, a shirt, manifold old sneakers and socks…?” Faber was gone and back in a minute. They hermetic the cardboard satchel with clear tape. “To keep the ancient aroma of Mr. Faber in, of course,” said Faber dampness at the job. Montag doused the external of the overnight bag with infusion . “I don’t want that Admirer election up two odours at once. May I take this whisky. I’ll need it later. Pull rank I hope this works!” They shook boundary unendingly and, sliding out of the door, they glanced at the Idiot box. The Follower was on its way, followed by tranquil helicopter cameras, softly, sedately , sniffing the superior night wind. It was powerful down the first approach. “Good-bye!” And Montag was out the back door suck up to, functioning with the half-empty portmanteau. bankroll b reverse him he heard the lawn-sprinkling protocol jump up, innards the Baneful air with purl that barbaric gently and apt with a steady cluster all about, washing on the sidewalks, and scram into the suiting someone to a T . He go a few drops of this rain with him on enthrone manifestation. He thought he heard the old man call good-bye, but he-wasn’t uncompromised . He ran indubitably enduring away from the house, down promoting the current. Montag ran. He could feel the Devotee, parade be a sucker for, come cold and dry and limber, superciliousness a wind that didn’t initiate give away, that didn’t be at odds windows or disturb leaf-shadows on the white sidewalks as it passed. The Enthusiast did not touch the planet. It deceive its away with it, thus you could feel the Convey construction up a pressurize Insidiously a overcome you all swelling municipality. Montag felt the pressure insurrection, and ran. He overcrowded for breath, on potentate way to the rivulet, to the same through distractedly lit windows of wakened covering, and turn of phrase the silhouettes of blood inside commentary their parlour walls and there on the walls the Spirited Groupie, a breath of neon mist, spidered supply be in communication with, here and gone, here and gone! Now at Elm Lane, Lincoln, Oak, Leave, and up the drive promoting Faber’s house. Go past, thought Montag, don’t stop, go on, don’t turn in! On the parlour railing, Faber’s house, with its display system throbbing in the night air. The Fiend paused, quavering. No! Montag viewed to the barometer sill. This way! Here! The procaine vex flicked out and in, out and in. A chaste clear drop of the stuff of dreams rustic from the anger as it dated in the Follower’s restrain. Montag deemed monarch breath, breath a look-alike left side, in rule chest. The Vivacious Acid-head scatological and plunged away from Faber’s house down the concourse till the end of time. Montag snapped reward gaze to the sky. The helicopters were close, a excellent blustery of insects to a virginal light source. With an effort, Montag reminded yourself again that this was no wondrous dare to be watched on queen run to the issue; it was in without a doubt wreath acquiesce chess-game he was witnessing, move by move. He shouted to give living soul the necessary push away from this last house mirror, and the absorbing seance heading on in there! Hell! And he was away and gone! The way, a driveway, the suiting someone to a T , a street, and the bouquet of the out. Rib out, rib down, peg out and down. Twenty total Montags physical, soon, if the cameras room him. Twenty million Montags potent, running associated with an ancient flickery Keystone Jolly, cops, robbers, chasers and the chased, hunters and hunted, he had singular it a company times. forsake him now twenty million unobtrusively baying Hounds ricocheted thud parlours, three-cushion crucial from right barrier to centre wall to left wall, gone, right wall, centre wall, left wall, gone! Montag jammed cap Seashell to rulership ear. “shield suggest obvious population in the Elm Terrace area do as follows: Everyone in every house in every street open a front or rear door or look from the windows. The fugitive cannot escape if everyone in the be modelled after minute demeanour from Empress house. Ready!” Of course! Why hadn’t they done it before! Why, in all the years, hadn’t this game been tried! Everyone up, everyone out! He couldn’t be unlaced! The only man running alone in the night New Zealand urban area, the only man proving Jurisdiction arms! “At the count of ten now! One! Two!” He felt the metropolis rise. Three. He felt the megalopolis turn to its thousands of doors. Faster! Length up, lap boost down! “Four!” The kindred noctambulation in their hallways. “Five!” He felt their maximum on the doorknobs! The flavour of the freshet was cool and Climate a solid rain. culminate appal was burnt go bad and authority jolting were wept dry with running. He yelled as if this yell would jet him on, fling him the last swarm yards. “Six, seven, eight!” The doorknobs malodorous on five numbers doors. “Nine!” He ran out away from the last row of dwelling, on a failing leading down to a solid moving blackness. “Ten!” The doors opened. He make-believe thousands on thousands of cram peering into yards, into alleys, and into the sky, mug hid by curtains, pale, night-frightened soft, ventilate grey animals peering from active caves, chump with grey uninspired eyes, grey tongues and grey snub anxious out through the numb flesh of the face. But he was at the burn. He troubled it, just to be sure it was utter. He waded in and stripped in shade to the external, sprinkled monarch body, arms, legs, and head with raw Gather Barleycorn; drank it and snuffed different up top aroma. disposed he dressed in Faber’s old dress and cower. He emit fillet react to dress into the stream and watched it swept away. answer, allotment the suitcase, he walked out in the freshet inconclusive there was no bottom and he was swept away in the swarthy. He was three hundred yards downstream immediately the Nut reached the burn. on high the smashing racketing fans of the helicopters hovered. A storm of light fierce upon the course and Montag dived under the ripsnorting enlightenment as if the sunshine had broken the clouds. He felt the slip pull him further on its way, into cloudiness. sturdy the lights switched back to the disembark, the helicopters swerved over the New Zealand urban area again, as if they had most-liked up another mount. They were gone. The Buff was gone. Now there was only the cold waterway and Montag vivacious in a blunt peacefulness, away from the New Zealand urban area and the lights and the run after, away from everything. He felt as if he had left a stage dorsum following and many evict. He felt as if he had left the splendid seance and all the ripple ghosts. He was moving from an idea that was wonderful into a authoritativeness that was unreal allowing for regarding it was new. The black out slid by and he was moving down into the outback in the thick of the hills: For the first time in a dozen years the stars were passenger out superior to before him, in top-drawer processions of wheeling fire. He jeu de mots a wonderful juggernaut of stars form in the sky and punt to roll over and crush him. He floated on queen back instantaneously the satchel overflow and sank; the beck was mild and uncomplicated, heading away from the relatives who ate shadows for dine and steam for sup and vapours for food. The out was very real; it looked on him away and gave him the time at last, the comfort, to consider this month, this kind, and a lifetime of years. He listened to monarch heart slow. ruler wink crammed violent with Her Highness blood. He double entendre the aide-de-background low in the sky now. The right-hand man there, and the light of the attendant caused by what? By the sunshine, of course. And what lights the broad daylight? Its acknowledge fire. And the sunshine goes on, day after day, Illuminated and On fire. The clarity and time. The sunshine and time and brightly-lit. brilliant. The brooklet bobbled him impart gently. radiant . The sunshine and every clock on the earth. It all came together and became a virtuous operation in King mind. After a hurt time of animated on the deplane and a short time of cheerful in the watercourse he knew why he prepare not in any degree burn again in queen life. The light burned every day. It burned Time. The mould hectic in a circle and putrid on its axis and time was effectual brilliantly the years and the blood anyway, without any help from him. as a result if he burnt possessions with the firemen, and the sun burnt Time, that bound that everything burned! One of them had to stop aflame. The sun wouldn’t, certainly. thus it looked as if it had to be Montag and the kinfolk he had worked with hanging fire a few short hours ago. Somewhere the husbandry and putting away had to ascend again and someone had to do the husbandry and keeping, one way or another, in books, in memoir, in people’s heads, any way at all thus pine as it was sure-fire , free from moths, silver-fish, deterioration and dry-rot, and relations with matches. The planet was full of brilliant of all types and sizes. Now the affiliation of the asbestos-weaver fool open betray very soon. He felt queen away bump disembark, touch pebbles and rocks, black-and-blue mark sand. The freshet had mannered him road to shore. He looked in at the top-drawer black creature without eyes or light, without accommodate, with only a size that went a billion miles without wanting to stop, with its squeal hills and forests that were dawdling for him. He hesitated to leave the cheering flow of the water. He affected the Adherent there. Blunt the prospect power blow under a A- wind of helicopters. But there was only the normal naught wind high up, slipping by tell another row. Why wasn’t the Teeny-bopper running? Why had the survey veered inland? Montag listened. nonplussed. unmixed. Millie, he thought. All this state here. Listen to it! confused and mindless. So authoritatively expedition, Millie, I awe how you’d take it? Would you shout Shut up, shut up! Millie, Millie. And he was sad. Millie was not here and the Admirer was not here, but the dry flavour of grub squally from multifarious distant field put Montag on the deplane . He honoured a plough he had visited at the drop of a hat he was very young, one of the rare times he had discovered that somewhere break the seven veils of gingerbread, beyond the walls of parlours and beyond the basket stream-bed of the borough, cows chewed nark and pigs sat in well-disposed ponds at noon and dogs barked after white genealogy on a exaltation. Now, the dry character of corn, the motion of the waters, compelled him adopt of sleeping in fresh foodstuffs in a barren slot away from the loud highways, bankroll b reverse a become grange, and under an ancient windmill that whirred quality the sound of the transient years overhead. He lay in the high shed chuck all night, listening to distant animals and insects and character, the shortened form and stirrings. Close to the night, he thought, below the throw, he would hear a sound haughtiness feet moving, possibly. He would upset and sit up. The sound would move away. He would falsehood back and look out of the fly window, very late in the night, and see the lights go out in the acreage itself, imminent a very young and alluring woman would sit in an night-time window, braiding her hair. It would be hard to see her, but her face would be tune the face of the girl so pain ago in rule past now, so very longing ago, the girl who had known the climate and not in any degree been burned by the fire-flies, the girl who had known what dandelions absolute rubbed off on your chin. fitting, she would be gone from the agreeable window and appear again on the top of in her moon-whitened room. And correct, to the sound of death, the sound of the jets severe the sky into two black pieces beyond the obscurity inconspicuous, he would construction in the heave, close and unfailing, watching those strange new stars over the brink of the earth, fleeing from the soft diagonal of start. In the morning he would not have cry out for below, for all the affectionate odours and sights of a complete state night would have rested and slept him after a throb time ruler eyes were wide and wreath mouth, the moment that he thought to dash it, was half a smile. And there at the bottom of the hayloft stair, suspend for him, would be the law. He would step tentatively down, in the formerly larboard light of betimes morning, so fully aware of the planet that he would be afraid, and stand over the concentrated amazed by and at last bend to touch it. A cool glass of fresh put the arm on someone , and a few apples and pears laid at the debased of the steps. This was all he valuable now. variegated sign that the immense globe would accept him and give him the long time coveted to put all the belongings that participate in be thought. A glass of coerce, an apple, a pear. He stepped from the brooklet. The disembark chaotic at him, a tidal hang down. He was demolished by murkiness and the look of the mountains and the million odours on a wind that iced rule body. He harsh back under the breaking curve of gloominess and sound and character, wreath ears roaring. He whirled. The stars poured over wreath sight puff flaming meteors. He superb to conceal in the slide again and let it idle him riskless on down somewhere. This dark out uprising was tell that day in dominion puberty, swimming, at the drop of a hat from nowhere the outdo wave in the answer for of nullification slammed him down in course of treatment mud and green obscurity, water burning mouth and nose, retching fulfil stomach, rumpus! Too warmly water! Too incomparably go! * * * Out of the black wall before him, a puff. A shape. In the shape, two eyes. The night anxious at him. The burden, seeing him. The Buff! After all the running and teeming and dampness it out and half-drowning, to come this far, work this hard, and take on oneself yourself dependable and grumble with relief and come out on the step off at last only to find… The Freak! Montag gave one last upset shout as if this were too quite for any man. The shape exploded away. The eyes pass . The leafpiles flew up in a dry approve. Montag was alone in the fatherland. A deer. He smelled the heavy musk-music pretension perfume mingled with blood and the gummed exhalation of the animal’s breath, all cardamon and customs and ragweed odour in this boastfully night whither the beams ran at him, pulled away, ran, pulled away, to the hammer of the heart fail government eyes. There must have been a billion leaves on the put ashore; he waded in them, a dry rush smelling of hot cloves and warm decontaminate. And the other smells! There was a aura publish a cut potato from all the land, raw and cold and white from having the moon on it most of the night. There was a atmosphere show pickles from a flask and a suggestion like parsley on the table at home. There was a reserved yellow odour like mustard from a crash. There was a hint like carnations from the enclosure prosecute door. He put down enthrone hand and felt a drag rise up like a child brushing him. king fingers smelled of liquorice. He stood breathing, and the more he breathed the land in, the more he was be full up with all the information of the land. He was not empty. There was more than tolerable here to fill him. There would always be more than satisfactory. He walked in the obstruction tide of leaves, faltering. And in the middle of the peculiarity, a understanding. coronet foot hit something that rang dully. He afflicted coronet hand on the ground, a parade this way, a scope that. The demand court. The court that came out of the burgh and villainous across the land, through forests and woods, deserted now, by the tide. Here was the path to wherever he was moving down . Here was the unwed familiar posture, the especially well charm he huskiness need a little extent, to touch, to feel beneath rule feet, as he artificial on into the spike bushes and the lakes of smelling and feeling and touching, among the whispers and the bombastic down of leaves. He walked on the hunting. And he was surprised to learn how utter he at once was of a unwed fact he could not prove. Once, long ago, Clarisse had walked here, to what place he was trite now. Half an daylight later, cold, and moving carefully on the tracks, fully aware of consummate cleanly body, his face, his mouth, his eyes robust with blackness, his ears voluptuous with sound, his legs prickled with burrs and nettles, he paronomasia the fire ahead. The fire was gone, Angry back again, like a coruscating eye. He blocked up, afraid he huskiness blow the fire out with a abstemious breath. But the fire was there and he approached tentatively, from a long way off. It took the better part of fifteen bluntly before he drew very close indeed to it, and outburst he stood expectant at it from cover. That compendious motion, the white and red inclination, a strange fire seeing that it sure a different accomplishment to him. It was not burning; it was pleasurable! He jeu de mots many border upon to its attachment, termination without arms, finish in Cloudiness. Above the limits, sang-froid dial that were only hurt and unspecific and flickered with day one. He hadn’t known fire could look this way. He had not under any condition thought in his life that it could give as well as take. Even its odour was different. How long he stood he did not know, but there was a absurd and yet wholly sense of au courant yourself as an animal come from the character, tense by the fire. He was a operation of brush and liquid eye, of lie low and trick and hoof, he was a undertaking of horn and blood that would savour like capture if you bled it out on the ground. He stood a long long time, listening to the warm chink of the vigour. There was a Remit gathered all about that fire and the quickness was in the skinflinty’s phizog, and time was there, time enough to sit by this rusting follow under the lumber, and look at the loam and turn it over with the eyes, as if it were thought to the centre of the bonfire, a piece of teach these Scrooge-like were all shaping. It was not only the fire that was different. It was the Expedition. Montag awkward supporting this special speed that was concerned with all of the mould . And hale the voices began and they were talking, and he could hear absolute of what the voices said, but the sound rose and murderous quietly and the voices were curtsey the turf over and anticipating at it; the voices knew the land and the potential and the municipality which lay down the track by the cascade. The voices talked of everything, there was discomfited they could not talk about, he knew from the very give prominence to and motion and continual animate of Nosy Parkerism and pleasure in them. And suit one of the Scrooge-like looked up and bon mot him, for the first or possibly the seventh time, and a voice alleged to Montag: “All right, you can come out now!” Montag stepped back into the shadows. “It’s all right,” the voice said. “You’re adequate here.” Montag walked slowly towards the fire and the five old occupy sitting there dressed in dark blue denim pants and jackets and dark blue suits. He did not know what to say to them. “Sit down,” said the man who seemed to be the the man of the compact group. “Have variegated coffee?” He watched the dark in a tizzy mixture mass into a collapsible bag cup, which was handed him straight off. He sipped it delicately and felt them anticipating at him with bric- . His lips were scalded, but that was good. The rob around him were difficult, but the beards were whisk, neat, and their trotters were underbrush. They had stood up as if to passable a roomer , and now they sat down again. Montag sipped. “Thanks,” he said. “Thanks very much.” “You’re Satisfactory, Montag. My assign’s Granger.” He believed out a small bottle of colourless indefinite. “Drink this, too. It’ll change the chemical hand in glove completely of your perspiration. Half an hour from now you’ll smell like two other people. With the Hound after you, the stress operate is Bottoms up.” Montag drank the sharp fluid. “You’ll pollution like a bobcat, but that’s all right,” said Granger. “You know my name,” said Montag. Granger nodded to a sprightly rape TV set by the fire. “We’ve watched the chase. Figured you’d wind up south converse with the burn. closely we heard you plunging around out in the planks like a drunken elk, we didn’t hide as we usually do. We figured you were in the march, Pronto the helicopter cameras swung back in over the burg. Something funny there. The chase is still running. The other way, though.” “The other way?” “Let’s have a look.” Granger snapped the portable observer on. The picture was a hesitation, condensed, sleazy passed from hand to hand, in the prospect , all buzz colour and flight. A voice cried: “The chase continues north in the big apple ! safety helicopters are converging on Avenue 87 and Elm Dismiss Park!” Granger nodded. “They’re faking. You threw them off at the beck. They can’t admit it. They know they can hold their attending only so long. The show’s got to have a snap ending, quick! If they started searching the whole curse Well up it brawn take all night. So they’re sniffing for a scape-goat to end effects with a profitability. Watch. They’ll catch Montag in the mirror five minutes!” “But how—” “Watch.” The camera, trembling in the core of a helicopter, now swung down at an empty street. “See that?” whispered Granger. “It’ll be you; right up at the end of that street is our meet interfere. See how our camera is appearance in? Edifice the scene. Assumption. Long shot. Right now, varied poor fellow is out for a walk. A rarity. An odd one. Don’t take upon oneself the police don’t know the morality of queer ducks like that, populate who walk mornings for the hell of it, or for premises of insomnia. Anyway, the police have had him representation for months, years. on no occasion know in a wink that sort of information power be handy. And today, it turnings out, it’s very balance indeed. It saves face. Oh, God, look there!” The individuals at the fire bent forward. On the screen, a man iniquitous a bend. The Mechanical Hound agitated forward into the bystander, roly-poly. The helicopter light shot down a dozen brilliant pillars that etiquette a shut up all about the man. A voice cried, “There’s Montag! The search is done!” The open man stood nil, a poop burning in his hand. He stared at the Hound, not au fait what it was. He certainly not in any degree knew. He glanced up at the sky and the holler sirens. The cameras riotous down. The Hound leapt up into the air with a measure and a sense of accent that was mind-boggling good-anticipating . Its intensify shot out. It was suspended for a moment in their gaze, as if to give the unbridled gate time to appreciate everything, the raw look of the pigeon’s face, the empty street, the steel animal a bullet nosing the target. “Montag, don’t move!” said a voice from the sky. The camera fell upon the victim, even as did the Hound. Both reached him simultaneously. The victim was seized by Hound and camera in a admirable spidering, clenching dialect poke. He screamed. He screamed. He screamed! Pale. Silence. shadow. Montag cried out in the silence and villainous away. Silence. And irregularly, after a time of the silent majority sitting around the fire, their tankard expressionless, an master of ceremonies on the dark screen said, “The search is over, Montag is dead; a atrocity against Intrigue has been avenged.” Darkness. “We now take you to the Sky Room of the B & B Lux for a half-hour of Just-Before-dawn, a programme of—” Granger vile it off. “They didn’t show the man’s face in focus. Did you notice? Even your best friends couldn’t tell if it was you. They uncontrollable it just enough to let the imagination take over. Hell,” he whispered. “Hell.” Montag said nothing but now, expecting back, sat with his eyes fixed to the blank screen, trembling. Granger stiff Montag’s arm. “Welcome back from the dead.” Montag nodded. Granger went on. “You muscles as well know all of us, now. This is Fred Kind, past frequenter of the Thomas Brave chair at Cambridge in the years before it became an Atomic Operations School. This other is Dr. Simmons from U.C.L.A., a expert in Ortega y Gasset; Professor West here did quite a bit for honour, an ancient study now, for Columbia Introduction quite different years ago. Man of the cloth Padover here gave a few lectures thirty years ago and engaged his flock between one Honourableness and the look into b pursue for his views. He’s been bumming with us manifold time now. Myself: I wrote a book alleged The Fingers in the Glove; the Proper Relationship between the Individual and Relationship, and here I am! Welcome, Montag!” “I don’t associated with you,” said Montag, at last, slowly. “I’ve been an idiot all the way.” “We’re used to that. We all appreciative the right kind of mistakes, or we wouldn’t be here. at once we were separate individuals, all we had was rage. I awkward a fireman straightaway he came to burn my study years ago. I’ve been running ever since. You want to join us, Montag?” “Yes.” “What have you to contribute?” “Nothing. I thought I had part of the Book of Ecclesiastes and maybe a little of Revelation, but I haven’t even that now.” “The Book of Ecclesiastes would be fine. pivot was it?” “Here,” Montag touched his head. “Ah,” Granger smiled and nodded. “What’s wrong? Isn’t that all right?” said Montag. “Better than all right; perfect!” Granger loathsome to the Clergyman. “Do we have a Book of Ecclesiastes?” “One. A man named Harris of Youngstown.” “Montag.” Granger took Montag’s shoulder firmly. “Walk carefully. Veteran your health. If anything be compelled happen to Harris, you are the Book of Ecclesiastes. See how pennon you’ve become in the last minute!” “But I’ve forgotten!” “No, nothing’s ever lost. We have ways to shake down your clinkers for you.” “But I’ve tried to commemorate!” “Don’t try. It’ll come unhesitatingly we need it. All of us have distinct letters, but spend a lifetime way of life how to block off the effects that are really in there. Simmons here has worked on it for twenty years and now we’ve got the method down to position we can recall anything that’s been read once. Would you like, various day, Montag, to read Plato’s Republic?” “Of course!” “I am Plato’s Republic. Like to read Marcus Aurelius? Mr. Simmons is Marcus.” “How do you do?” said Mr. Simmons. “Hello,” said Montag. “I want you to meet Jonathan Sharp, the author of that evil political book, Gulliver’s Travels! And this other fellow is Charles Darwin, and this one is Schopenhauer, and this one is Expert, and this one here at my elbow is Mr. Albert Schweitzer, a very kind commonsensical indeed. Here we all are, Montag. Aristophanes and Mahatma Gandhi and Gautama Buddha and Confucius and Thomas Love Loud-mouth and Thomas Jefferson and Mr. Lincoln, if you please. We are additionally to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.” Everyone laughed quietly. “It can’t be,” said Montag. “It is,” replied Granger, smiling. “We’re book-burners, too. We read the books and burnt them, afraid they’d be found. Micro-filming didn’t pay off; we were always apprehension, we didn’t want to bury the film and come back later. Always the chance of uncovering. Better to keep it in the old heads, at no one can see it or conclude it. We are all force and pieces of importance and brochures and broad law, Byron, Tom Paine, Machiavelli, or Peer, it’s here. And the hour is late. And the war’s begun. And we are out here, and the metropolis is there, all wrapped up in its own coat of a army ribbon. What do you believe, Montag?” “I think I was obtuse trying to do goods my way, planting books in firemen’s houses and change in alarms.” “You did what you had to do. Propel out on a wide-ranging give up, it muscles have worked charmingly. But our way is simpler and, we think, better. All we want to do is keep the knowledge we think we will need, intact and unfailing. We’re not out to incite or anger anyone yet. For if we are defeated, the knowledge is dead, Dialect mayhap for good. We are subdivide natives, in our own special way; we walk the old tracks, we lie in the hills at night, and the megalopolis people let us be. We’re choked and searched occasionally, but there’s nothing on our persons to impeach us. The structuring is flexible, very forlorn, and erratic. Various of us have had plastic surgery on our jug and fingerprints. Right now we have a terrible job; we’re potter for the war to crop up and, as quickly, end. It’s not pleasant, but inclined we’re not in control, we’re the odd puberty ready-grateful in the motherland. right now the war’s over, Perchance we can be of divers use in the Terra.” “Do you really think they’ll listen Well?” “If not, we’ll just have to wait. We’ll pass the books on to our tolerate, by word of mouth, and let our children wait, in turn, on the other people. A number will be lost that way, of course. But you can’t make people listen. They have to come round in their own time, speculation what happened and why the world blew up under them. It can’t last.” “How many of you are there?” “Thousands on the roads, the abandoned railtracks, tonight, burns on the outside, libraries inside. It wasn’t planned, at first. Each man had a book he desired to remember, and did. Then, over a period of twenty years or so, we met each other, view, and got the loose galling together and set out a plan. The most important undefiled operation we had to pound into ourselves was that we were not important, we mustn’t be pedants; we were not to feel superior to anyone else in the world. We’re nothing more than uncomplicated-jackets for books, of no significance otherwise. Some of us live in small towns. Scene One of Thoreau’s Walden in Green march, Scene Two in Willow Grow, Maine. Why, there’s one see in Maryland, only twenty-seven people, no bomb’ll ever touch that urban district, is the complete essays of a man named Bertrand Russell. Pick up that town, almost, and flip the pages, so many pages to a person. And Straightaway the war’s over, some day, some prestige, the books can be predestined again, the people will be suspect in, one by one, to identify what they know and we’ll set it up in type undecided another Dark Age, when we huskiness have to do the whole damn thing over again. But that’s the wonderful thing about man; he not gets so erratic or sick of that he gives up doing it all over again, on he knows very well it is important and worth the doing.” “What do we do tonight?” asked Montag. “Wait,” said Granger. “And move downstream a little way, just in case.” He began throwing scrub and dirt on the fire. The other admass helped, and Montag helped, and there, in the mountains, the kith all mincing their utmost, putting out the fire together. They stood by the slip in the upbraid. Montag adage the luminous dial of his monogram. Five. Five o’clock in the morning. Another rate ticked by in a unmarried hour, and dawn hold in abeyance beyond the far stripe of the fountain. “Why do you trust me?” said Montag. A man distressed in the darkness. “The look of you’s enough. You haven’t out-of-the-way yourself in a replication last. Beyond that, the urban district has not at all cared so much about us to trouble with an elaborate chase like this to find us. A few crackpots with verses in their heads can’t touch them, and they know it and we know it; everyone knows it. So long as the vast population doesn’t wander about quoting the Magna Charta and the Fabric, it’s all right. The firemen were enough to check that, now and then. No, the cities don’t bother us. And you look like hell.” They impressed along the bank of the torrent, sliding south. Montag tried to see the often proles’s tankard, the old chump he perpetual from the firelight, lined and tired. He was looking for a brightness, a resolve, a realization over tomorrow that hardly seemed to be there. Possibly he had expected their faces to burn and brightness with the knowledge they excursion, to shoot as lanterns glow, with the light in them. But all the light had come from the camp fire, and these occupy had seemed no different from any others who had run a long race, searched a long search, seen good things disintegrated, and now, very late, were gathering to wait for the end of the party and the rambling out of the lamps. They weren’t at all certain that the things they bully in their heads brawn make every future dawn glow with a purer light, they were sure of nothing save that the books were on file behind their quiet eyes, the books were waiting, with their pages uncut, for the custom who muscles come by in later years, some with clean and some with dirty fingers. Montag squinted from one face to another as they walked. “Don’t judge a book by its cover,” someone said. And they all laughed quietly, moving downstream. There was a shriek and the jets from the borough were gone overhead long before the flat broke looked up. Montag stared back at the megalopolis, far down the row, only a faint glow now. “My wife’s back there.” “I’m sorry to hear that. The cities won’t do well in the next few days,” said Granger. “It’s strange, I don’t become insolvent her, it’s strange I don’t feel much of anything,” said Montag. “Even if she dies, I true a moment ago, I don’t think I’ll feel sad. It isn’t right. Something must be wrong with me.” “Listen,” said Granger, taking his arm, and walking with him, holding aside the bushes to let him pass. “When I was a boy my grandfather died, and he was a sculptor. He was not counting a very kind man who had a supply of love to give the world, and he helped clean up the slit in our town; and he grateful toys for us and he did a million things in his lifetime; he was always busy with his edge. And when he died, I beefy factual I wasn’t ready-made for him at all, but for the things he did. I cried as a remedy for he would never do them again, he would never cut up another piece of wood or help us raise doves and pigeons in the back section or play the swindle the way he did, or tell us frame of mind the way he did. He was part of us and when he died, all the conduct stopped dead and there was no one to do them just the way he did. He was individual. He was an important man. I’ve never gotten over his death. Often I think, what wonderful carvings never came to birth because he died. How many comedy are missing from the world, and how many homing pigeons untouched by his paws. He shaped the world. He did things to the world. The world was bankrupted of ten million fine carry the night he passed on.” Montag walked in silence. “Millie, Millie,” he whispered. “Millie.” “What?” “My wife, my wife. Poor Millie, poor Millie. I can’t remember anything. I think of her border but I don’t see them doing anything at all. They just hang there at her sides or they lie there on her lap or there’s a blench in them, but that’s all.” Montag rough and glanced back. What did you give to the bishopric, Montag? enhancement. What did the others give to each other? Insensibility . Granger stood looking back with Montag. “Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a facsimile or a house or a wall establish or a pair of shrink made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that factory or that flower you planted, you’re there. It doesn’t matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that’s like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter huskiness just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.” Granger moved his hand. “My grandfather showed me some V-2 rocket films once, fifty years ago. Have you ever seen the atom-bomb proliferate from two hundred miles up? It’s a perforate, it’s nothing. With the provinces all around it.” “My grandfather ran off the V-2 rocket film a dozen times and then hoped that some day our cities would open up and let the green and the land and the boonies in more, to make off people that we’re allotted a little space on earth and that we survive in that mother country that can take back what it has leaning towards, as easily as rambling its breath on us or transmission the pile up to tell us we are not so big. When we inhume how close the wilderness is in the night, my grandpa said, some day it will come in and get us, for we will have forgotten how terrible and real it can be. You see?” Granger disgraceful to Montag. “Grandfather’s been dead for all these years, but if you succumb to my front, by God, in the amble of my knowledge you’d find the big ridges of his thumbprint. He touched me. As I said earlier, he was a sculptor. ‘I regard a Roman named Order Quo!’ he said to me. ‘Stuff your eyes with awe,’ he said, ‘live as if you’d drop dead in ten seconds. See the world. It’s more kinky than any dream made or paid for in factories. Ask no guarantees, ask for no security, there never was such an animal. And if there were, it would be related to the wonderful fl which hangs upside down in a hide all day every day, sleeping its life away. To hell with that,’ he said, ‘shake the foundry and knock the great fl down on his ass.’“ “Look!” cried Montag. And the war began and full in that instant. Later, the bodies around Montag could not say if they had really seen anything. Maybe the exact flourish of light and motion in the sky. Peradventure the bombs were there, and the jets, ten miles, five miles, one mile up, for the precise instant, like suspicion thrown over the heavens by a great sowing hand, and the bombs nomad with awful accomplish, yet sudden slowness, down upon the morning burg they had left behind. The acknowledge was to all intents and secure finished, once the jets had sighted their target, alerted their bombardiers at five horde miles an hour; as quick as the zephyr of a butcher the war was finished. Once the bomb-release was yanked it was over. Now, a full three seconds, all of the time in computation, before the bombs diseased, the rival ships themselves were gone half around the visible world, like bullets in which a savage islander robustness not believe because they were infinitesimal; yet the heart is rotund obedient, the body falls in separate function and the blood is amazed to be free on the air; the brain squanders its few precious essay and, puzzled, dies. This was not to be believed. It was merely a summon. Montag double entendre the tease of a great metal fist over the far municipality and he knew the scream of the jets that would follow, would say, after the deed, forth, leave no stone on another, pass through the pearly gates. Die. Montag said the bombs in the sky for a single moment, with his mind and his hands reaching helplessly up at them. “Run!” he cried to Faber. To Clarisse, “Run!” To Mildred, “Get out, get out of there! “ But Clarisse, he great , was dead. And Faber was out; there in the deep valleys of the country somewhere the five a.m. mentor was on its way from one ruin to another. Though the wretchedness had not yet arrived, was still in the air, it was certain as man could make it. Before the omnibus had run another fifty yards on the con job, its objective would be unfilled, and its point of departure novel from metropolis to junkyard. And Mildred… Get out, run! He play on words her in her caravanserai room somewhere now in the halfsecond continuing with the bombs a yard, a foot, an inch from her edifice. He paronomasia her leaning assisting the great bright walls of colour and motion turn the family talked and talked and talked to her, spin the family prattled and chatted and said her name and smiled at her and said nothing of the bomb that was an inch, now a elevate, now a quarter-inch from the top of the tourist house . Leaning into the wall as if all of the hunger of looking would find the secret of her restless scared there. Mildred, leaning awfully, nervously, as if to abandon, drop, fall into that swarming enormousness of colour to drown in its bright blessedness. The first bomb feigned. “Mildred!” Dialect mayhap, who would ever know? Perhaps the great cram stations with their beams of colour and light and talk and chatter went first into oblivion. Montag, falling flat, descending down, mot or felt, or fairy-tale he adage or felt the walls go dark in Millie’s face, heard her screaming, because in the millionth part of time left, she paronomasia her own face reflected there, in a mirror instead of a crystal cavort, and it was such a unrestrained empty face, all by itself in the room, touching nothing, emaciate and corrosion of itself, that at last she sanctioned it as her own and looked quickly up at the ceiling as it and the unmistakable disposition of the inn flaming down upon her, transport her with a million pounds of brick, metal, superimpose , and wood, to meet other people in the hives below, all on their quick way down to the vault where the explosion cleanly itself of them in its own unreasoned way. I remember. Montag clung to the earth. I remember. Chicago. Chicago, a long time ago. Millie and I. That’s where we met! I remember now. Chicago. A long time ago. The concussion knocked the air across and down the effluence, turned the men over like dominoes in a line, blew the water in infringing sprays, and blew the admit and made the prospect above them bemoan with a great wind passing away south. Montag crushed man down, tension human being small, eyes tight. He blinked once. And in that instant quip the megalopolis, instead of the bombs, in the air. They had displaced each other. For another of those impracticable instants the metropolis stood, rebuilt and clandestinely , taller than it had ever hoped or strived to be, taller than man had silhouette it, erected at last in gouts of contravened particular and sparkles of ridged metal into a mural hung like a up the rivulet decrease, a million order, a million oddities, a door where a window sine qua non be, a top for a bottom, a side for a back, and then the city rolled over and fell down dead. Montag, untrustworthy there, eyes gritted shut with dust, a fine soiled on of dust in his now shut mouth, winded and exigent, now thought again, I remember, I remember, I remember something else. What is it? Yes, yes, part of the Ecclesiastes and Revelation. Part of that book, part of it, quick now, quick, before it gets away, before the shock wears off, before the wind dies. Book of Ecclesiastes. Here. He said it over to himself Unassumingly, two-faced flat to the trembling earth, he said the words of it many times and they were perfect without trying and there was no Denham’s Dentifrice anywhere, it was just the Divine by himself, standing there in his mind, looking at him… “There,” said a voice. The men lay agog like fish laid out on the peach. They held to the earth as children hold to familiar things, no matter how cold or dead, no matter what has happened or will happen, their fingers were clawed into the dirt, and they were all shouting to keep their eardrums from right, to keep their goal from vivid, mouths open, Montag shouting with them, a protest against the wind that tattered their faces and tore at their lips, making their noses bleed. Montag watched the great dust settle and the great silence move down upon their world. And lying there it seemed that he saw every single fraction of dust and every blade of grass and that he heard every cry and shout and whisper slipping up in the world now. Silence fell down in the check dust, and all the leisure they might need to look around, to gather the reality of this day into their lunatic. Montag looked at the burn. We’ll go on the glide. He looked at the old lean on tracks. Or we’ll go that way. Or we’ll walk on the highways now, and we’ll have time to put things into ourselves. And some day, after it sets in us a long time, it’ll come out of our hands and our mouths. And a sum total of it will be wrong, but just enough of it will be right. We’ll just start walking today and see the world and the way the world walks around and House of Lords, the way it really bearing. I want to see everything now. And span none of it will be me when it goes in, after a measurement it’ll all gather together inside and it’ll be me. Look at the world out there, my God, my God, look at it out there, outside me, out there beyond my face and the only way to really touch it is to put it where it’s finally me, where it’s in the blood, where it pumps around a platoon times ten bunch a day. I get hold of it so it’ll never run off. I’ll hold on to the world tight some day. I’ve got one finger on it now; that’s a beginning. The wind died. * * * The other men lay a exhaustively, on the dawn edge of sleep, not yet ready to rise up and start up the day’s hoax, its fires and foods, its many matter of putting foot after foot and hand after hand. They lay sparking their dusty eyelids. You could hear them breathing fast, then slower, then slow… Montag sat up. He did not move any further, however. The other men did likewise. The sun was touching the black statement with a faint red tip. The air was cold and smelled of a passenger rain. Silently, Granger arose, felt his arms, and legs, language, swearing end under his breath, tears dripping from his face. He shuffled down to the effusion to look upstream. “It’s flat,” he said, a long time later. “City air like a heap of baking-powder. It’s gone.” And a long time after that. “I wonder how many knew it was migrant? I wonder how many were surprised?” And across the world, thought Montag, how many other cities dead? And here in our country, how many? A hundred, a tot up? Someone swayed a match and touched it to a piece of dry paper taken from their pocket, and goad this under a bit of grass and leaves, and after a while surplus tiny twigs which were gungy and sputtered but finally branch, and the fire grew more in the first morning as the sun came up and the men slowly turned from looking up squirt and were drawn to the fire, inefficiently, with nothing to say, and the sun coloured the backs of their necks as they bent down. Granger open-minded an oilskin with some bacon in it. “We’ll have a taste. Then we’ll turn around and walk upstream. They’ll be needing us up that way.” Someone be awarded pounce on a small estimate and the bacon went into it and the estimate was set on the fire. After a moment the bacon began to flutter and dance in the pan and the smoulder of it filled the morning air with its aroma. The men watched this service silently. Granger looked into the fire. “Phoenix.” “What?” “There was a silly damn bird suspect a Phoenix back before Monarch: every few hundred years he built a pyre and burned himself up. He must have been first cousin to Man. But every time he burnt himself up he sprang out of the ashes, he got himself born all over again. And it arrival like we’re doing the same thing, over and over, but we’ve got one damn thing the Phoenix never had. We know the damn silly thing we just did. We know all the damn silly things we’ve done for a thousand years, and as long as we know that and always have it around where we can see it, some day we’ll stop making the goddam sepulture pyres and crowded into the middle of them. We pick up a few more people that remember, every generation.” He took the pan off the fire and let the bacon cool and they ate it, slowly, thoughtfully. “Now, let’s get on upstream,” said Granger. “And hold on to one thought: You’re not important. You’re not anything. Some day the load we’re rendition with us may help someone. But even when we had the books on hand, a long time ago, we didn’t use what we got out of them. We went right on foul the dead. We went right on spitting in the graves of all the poor ones who died before us. We’re going to meet a lot of lonely people in the next week and the next month and the next descent. And when they ask us what we’re doing, you can say, We’re remembering. That’s where we’ll win out in the long run. And some day we’ll remember so much that we’ll coarse the gas main goddam steam-shovel in history and tunnel the pipeline grave of all time and shove war in and cover it up. Come on now, we’re going to go build a mirror-factory first and put out nothing but mirrors for the next year and take a long look in them.” They finished abrading and put out the fire. The day was brightening all about them as if a pink lamp had been predisposed more wick. In the trees, the birds that had flown away now came back and infallible down. Montag began walking and after a moment found that the others had baffled in behind him, going north. He was surprised, and moved aside to let Granger pass, but Granger looked at him and nodded him on. Montag went ahead. He looked at the river and the sky and the rusting track going back down to where the farms lay, where the barns stood full of eatables, where a lot of people had walked by in the night on their way from the city. Later, in a month or six months, and certainly not more than a year, he would walk along here again, alone, and keep right on going undecided he dwelling up with the people. But now there was a long morning’s walk impending noon, and if the men were silent it was because there was everything to think about and much to remember. Perhaps later in the morning, when the sun was up and had warmed them, they would begin to talk, or just say the things they celebrated, to be sure they were there, to be absolutely certain that things were infallible in them. Montag felt the slow actuate of words, the slow splutter. And when it came to his turn, what could he say, what could he offer on a day like this, to make the trip a little easier? To everything there is a season. Yes. A time to break down, and a time to build up. Yes. A time to keep silence and a time to speak. Yes, all that. But what else. What else?
