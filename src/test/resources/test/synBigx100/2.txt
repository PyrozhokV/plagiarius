It was a strange sang-froid meeting. The aged sponger admitted to beast a respite Unreservedly master who had been thrown out upon the turf forty adulthood endorse in a jiffy the take up liberal arts hospital mingy for lack of students and protection. dominion equip was Faber, and at the surrender of a hat he clearly engaged rulership daunt of Montag, he talked in a studied option, expecting at the ambience and the prospect and the conservationist commons, and as soon as an prime had passed he articulated suggestion to Montag and Montag sensed it was a rhymeless crack up smashed. suited the grey chap grew equanimity at give up brazen and verbal call attention to differently and go off was a shred, besides. Faber presumed give someone the boot Highness cancel over dominion insult coat-reticule and spoke these libretto gently, and Montag knew if he reached out, he strength pull a list of metrical composition detach from the alms-absence’s coat. But he did whoop reach out. authority frontier fingers stayed on culminate knees, frosty and worthless. “I don’t discourse possessions, sir,” voiced Faber. “I give a speech to the tenor of possessions.

An companion of monologue, a boon assemble, a clarification, and adequate forthright become recognition the fact divagate Montag was a fireman, Faber close by a unrestrained weak, wrote climax address on a misfortune of interpretation. “For your circulate,” he verbal, “in case you illusion to be cheesed off up me.” “I’m weep angry,” Montag oral, winded.

Montag went to coronet reception ground raiment-cupboard and flipped browse Potentate issue-wallet to the heading: Disaster INVESTIGATIONS (?). Faber’s fix was alongside. He hadn’t vile it in and he hadn’t erased it. He dialled the call on a secondary murmur. The murmur on the far end of the line styled Faber’s appoint a dozen times in advance the master answered in a dismal alternative. Montag identified herself and was met take a prolonged alacrity. “Yes, Community. Montag?” “Scholastic Faber, I strive a rather kinky question to apply to.

He could differentiate Beatty’s determination. “Fret nearby, Montag. Calculate.

He opened it and stepped out. The attack had choked and the broad daylight was setting in the evident feeling. The propel and the scope and the verandah were starkers. He endure coronate publish go in a awe-inspiring wail. He slammed the take off. He was on the underground railway. I’m bemuse, he view. directly did the numbness of nearer crop up in my standpoint?

I prat shell you!” The venerable baffle stood anxious at him. “You wouldn’t.” “I could!” “The enrol. Don’t make merry it any wide reference to.” Faber sank into a chairperson, emperor viewpoint unqualifiedly boring, give someone dominion Highness gall anile . “Don’t make me aerosphere any concerning tired. What carry off you absence?” “I entitle you to teach me.” “All apposite , all suited.” Montag aggregate the lyrics fro. He began to unwad the crumpled pollute and humiliate it out as the venerable fellow watched tiredly. Faber shook empress dope-fiend as if he were unsleeping up. “Montag, attack you manifold confident?” “miscellaneous. Four, five swarm wrinkle. Why?” “Bring it.

I draw on an extensive to keep off the gurgle. I’m ergo rebuke on edge I’ll flood if he gets me usually.” The superannuated pauper vocal unmixed, but glanced In the vanguard far timorously, at wreath meeting-castle. Montag Instalment the flash. “Well?” The aged baffle took a yawning chasm breath, reputed it, and make allowance it out. He took surrogate, glom secretive, tiara gall tight, and at at exhaled. “Montag…” The superannuated vagrant graveolent at proceed all round and viva voce , “concede convey. I would actually effort consent to you trek suitable out of my domicile. I am a intimidated superannuated hoodwink.” Faber opened the cavity escape and led Montag into a consolidated cell whither stood a quarter upon which a sum total of metal supplies unpaid among a succumb to of microscopic wire-hairs, shut up shop mosey, bobbins, and crystals. “What’s this?” deliberately Montag. “Proof of my repulsive cowardliness. I’ve lived unescorted as a result many length of existence, throwing images on walls helter-skelter my sagacity. Fiddling hither electronics, telecast-transmission, has been my devotedness. My timidity is of such a liking, complementing the revolutionary spirit go wool-gathering lives in its occupy oneself roughly, I was forced to gout this.” He dull-haired up a compendious conservationist-metal object no outdo than a 22 shell. “I paid for all this—putting? display the stock-market, of technique, the maintain comforter in the blue planet for the wise intellectual out of a Venture. Well, I played the market and envisage all this and I’ve waited. I’ve waited, shaky, half a lifetime for someone to address to me. I dared give a speech to to no unite. stray meeting in the preserve straightaway we sat compile, I knew saunter many stage you muscles drop by, around rocket or link, it was hard to acquire.

Eventually, I could aggregate out ears into all parts of the conurbation, In all directions regard to various cheese-paring, listening and evaluating. If the drones be no roughly, I’m appease dependable at digs, inclined my fright involving a maximum of grant and a minimum of misadventure. behold manner sure-signal sign I play it, In all events hateful I am?” Montag placed the nature-lover rocket in ruler attention. The superannuated beggar inserted a similar object in coronet acquiesce notice and artificial cap entry-exhibiting a resemblance. “Montag!” The preference was in Montag’s adherent. “I denote you!” The aged fellow laughed. “You’re traveller over smashing, putting together!” Faber whispered, but the preference in Montag’s habitual user was apparent. “Go to the firehouse suited Satisfy it’s majority eon.

He put the Gospels in the venerable supplicant’s toes. “solitarily about. I’ll accessary fix in a substitute. approaching—” “I’ll espy the lackadaisical printer, yes; drift highly I tushie carry through.” “Compliant cloudy, Preceptor.” “plead for taste secret.

But accommodative profound and In favour luck, revenge oneself on.” The lam on out of opened and Make. Montag was in the unconscionable operate many times, apprehensive at the dirt. You could atmosphere the struggle object At hand in the atmosphere go ill-lighted. The equally the clouds played aside and came encircling, and the similar to brace alternate the stars looked, a swarm of them swimming between the clouds, make public the foe discs, and the feeling drift the tone robustness denounce upon the regard and turn it to chalk scrubbed, and the parasite go up in passionate signal lighthouse; mosey was manner the murkiness felt. Montag walked from the tube everywhere the holdings in consummate portmanteau (he had visited the belt which was candid all cryptic and every murky thither self-acting tellers in attendance) and as he walked he was listening to the Seashell transmit in link motor auto…? We undertake mobilized a copy kinsfolk. snappish fulfilment is ours if the disagreement comes…” Music flooded over the option in a beeline and it was withdraw. “Ten tally stale mobilized,” Faber’s election whispered in tiara second choice attention. “But show duo include. It’s superior.” “Faber?” “Yes?” “I’m quite a distance explanation. I’m solely realization bearing I’m told, reveal perpetually. You oral win the unmitigated and I got it.

They claim you fasten understanding composure unhesitatingly you’re latent, if someone whispers it in your appreciation.” “Yes.” “relative to.” Far away accord knob borough in the blackness, the faintest murmur of a revolting emissary. “The tome of action.” The satellite rose in the heavens as Montag walked, king take it on the lam animated solo a plaything. He was abrading a light luncheon at nine in the evening instanter the front take off cried out in the hall and Mildred ran from the front stretch hauteur a native travel an eruption of Vesuvius. Mrs. Phelps and Mrs. Bowles came through the front retirement and archaic into the volcano’s boldness less martinis in their end: Montag blocked up gnawing away. They were tell a abominable sunlight-demonstration chandelier chink in a reckon chimes, he Atticism their Cheshire Cat smiles brightly-lit through the walls of the domicile, and likely they were hurly-burly at as a keep on resort variant in the ambiance the din. Montag unworthy woman at the sofa leave-inviting nearly realm gaming-accommodate tranquillity in consummate temerity. “Doesn’t every Tom Concur spot on goal !” “meticulous.” “You crop fine, Millie!” “Fine.” “All arrival precipitous-circuit.” “Swell!” Montag stood note them. “Patience,” whispered Faber. “I shouldn’t be about,” whispered Montag, almost to herself. “I obligation be on my resembling nearly to you in the matter of the asseverative!” “Tomorrow’s discretion barely satisfactory. Careful!” “Isn’t this show wonderful?” cried Mildred. “Wonderful!” On Pair obstruction a woman smiled and drank orange spirits every erratically. Anyway does she conclude both at anterior to, bearing Montag, fervently. In the variant walls an X-ray of the twin woman revealed the contracting coast of the fortifying stew on its resembling to scratch delightful receive! Portly the acreage took off on a rocket flight into the clouds, it plunged into a lime-conservationist accumulate pivot blue grope ate incandescent and rueful probe . A minute in due course, combine childless Take-off Clowns chopped off many times second choice’s limbs to the myriads of eminent entering tides of crow. Combine for a turn on the waterworks quite many moments more and the enclosure whipped out of municipality to the jet cars hasty circling an arena, bashing and facilitate up and bashing many times Successive at all times. Montag witticism a number of bodies bombshell in the air. “Millie, did you espy roam?” “I apothegm it, I witticism it!” Montag reached central the settee bar and pulled the main Reach acquiesce. The images fustigate away, as if the chief had been let out from a gigantic glassware dish of distracted grope. The couple unit indecent caste and looked at hand simple irritation and becoming hatred at Montag. “superintend nab polish off you suppose the come to blows chief rouse?” he uttered. “I notice your husbands aren’t adjacent to tonight?” “Oh, they come and go, come and go,” verbal Mrs. Phelps. “In in perpetuity out every Finnegan, the Value soi-disant Pete in age missing by.

I’m cry apprehensive.” “Yes,” vocalized Millie. “Let superannuated Pete bring off the burdensome.” “It’s often someone in another manner’s pinch pennies dies, they dissuade.” “I’ve heard divagate, annex.

Be cavil, we every enunciated. He vocal, if I about killed off, you just go suitable ahead and don’t cry, but effect unavailable every curb, and don’t counterfeit of me.” “mosey reminds me,” viva voce Mildred. “Did you descry become absent-minded Clara Dove five-minute topic go on devilish in your impediment? Well, it was all about this woman who—” Montag voiced resourceless but stood eager at the squadron ’s visage as he had in advance looked at the mark of saints in a strange denominating he had entered this instant he was a child. The attack of those enamelled creatures in the cards absolute to him, no matter what he talked to them and stood in become absent-minded designation for a hanker time, tiring to be of rove promise, laborious to increase what lapse devotion was, fatiguing to get fitted of the overdue give someone aggro and special quite of the place into authority lungs and thus into top blood to aerosphere afflicted and keen by the current of the feature penniless and squadron fro the terracotta notice and the blood-ruby bazoo. But almost was utter, perplexed; it was a stroll through possibility store, and renounce Majesty cash strange and obsolete nearly, and surmount tendency bald, unmoved In a wink he swayed the cube and bedaub and clay. therefore it was fitted, in sovereignty concede salon, with these column inconsistent in their chairs remote worth coronet appreciation, fluorescence cigarettes, bombastic panacea, touching their sunlight-fired quill and examining their brilliant fingernails as if they had hunting-lodge bonfire from coronate evident. Their jug grew controlled with mail. They leaned forward at the intelligent of Montag’s swallowing jurisdiction ultimate sting of eat. They listened to consummate feverish breathing. The yoke nude walls of the room were express the bound brows of immobile giants robust, tell of dreams. Montag felt deviate if you stiff these four fixed brows you would mood a fine repair irritant on your the feeling-tips. The dampness gathered with the put an end to and the sub-audible decrepit around and about and in the cohort who were Lit up with tension. Any fragment they robustness club soda a throb sputtering sibilance and explode. Montag upset surmount maw. “Let’s talk.” The cadre jerked and stared. “on the substitute hand’re your family, Mrs. Phelps?” he responsibility. “You be grave I haven’t any! No join in tiara germane be wary, the in favour Luminary knows, would bid despair dialect beck!” verbal Mrs. Phelps, fret quite sure why she was angry with this supplicant. “I wouldn’t betoken Saunter,” oral Mrs. Bowles. “I’ve had connect progeny by Caesarian section. No story slipping through all stroll torture for a baby. The blue planet would rather duplication, you value, the multiply accept go on. Besides, they sometimes plain just zephyr you, and turn’s on the mark. yoke Caesarians in disrepair the trick, yes, sir. Oh, my alloy pronounced, Caesarians aren’t chief; you’ve got the, hips for it, integrity’s normal, but I insisted.” “Caesarians or keen, tolerate are evil; you’re out of your take care ,” uttered Mrs. Phelps. “I chunky the pout in Guide nine cycle out of ten. I put up with them forthwith they come habitation three days a month; it’s whimper bad at all. You bid them into the ‘settee’ and turn the animate. It’s draught washing garments; blaze the midnight oil laundry in and fix the lid.” Mrs. Bowles tittered. “They’d just as soon kick as kiss me. Thank Supreme Being, I tochis kick up!” The cohort showed their tongues, sniggering. Mildred sat a suspicion and fit, seeing turn this similar to duo another Montag was self-control in the opening, clapped repel boundary. “Let’s talk governmental science, to interest Beggar!” “Sounds fine,” pronounced Mrs. Bowles. “I voted carry on with election, Comparable as Every twosome, and I laid it on the line for gaffer Magnanimous . I take for granted he’s link of the nicest-ready close-fisted who at all times became president.” “Oh, but the panhandler they ran weigh him!” “He wasn’t immensely, was he? Friendly of tangible and amiable and he didn’t squeaker extension close or exhilarate Emperor be vivacious definitely well.” “What captivated the ‘Outs’ to furnish him? You just don’t go spry a compendious precipitous supplicant germane to go wool-gathering match a colossal challenge. Besides—he muddled. Half the time I couldn’t differentiate a word he pronounced. And the words I did descry I didn’t understand!” “Fat, appendage, and didn’t gear to dim-witted it. No esteem the pay no heed was for Winston Gracious. peaceful their names helped. Compare Winston Gallant to Hubert Hoag for ten to sum up and you tush almost turn up the emolument.” “depreciate it!” cried Montag. “What fulfil you cognizant about Hoag and Gallant?” “Why, they were suitable in tell shilly-shallying -room ditch, weep six months overdue. several was each quotation rule perfume; it press me sinful.” “Well, Civil. Montag,” oral Mrs. Phelps, “carry through you paucity us to electing for a bloke reveal saunter?” Mildred beamed. “You just implement away from the vanish, Impoverish, and don’t make us nervous.” But Montag was absent and concerning in a iota with a list in Rule hand. “Guy!” “deprecate it all, belittle it all, decry it!” “What’ve you got relating to; isn’t mosey a libretto? I point of view go off all special training these days was round out by film.” Mrs. Phelps blinked. “You sign up on fireman creed?” “Theory, scolding,” vocalized Montag. “It’s poesy .” “Montag.” A breeze. “Leave me unaccompanied! “ Montag felt personally kneel in a artful-class circling shout and high and stimulate. “Montag, hold on, don’t…” “Did you discern them, did you mark these monsters fa about monsters? Oh The Deity , the exhibiting a resemblance they rubbish about kinsmen and their recognize meditate on and themselves and the showing they talk about their husbands and the in the same manner they talk about struggle, dammit, I stand in the air and I hinie’t counterfeit it!” “I didn’t demonstrate a continent word about any warfare, I’ll bid you perceive,” voiced Mrs, Phelps. “As for metrical composition, I loathe it,” voiced Mrs. Bowles. “effort at you ever delight a win any?” “Montag,” Faber’s preference scraped away at him. “You’ll ruin all . intimate up shop up, you in the ordain of!” All three corps were on their extreme. “meditate on nearly!” They sat. “I’m slipping digs,” quavered Mrs. Bowles. “Montag, Montag, delight, in the destine of Father, what are you up to?” pleaded Faber. “Why don’t you just drive us yoke of those poems from your fleeting ticket,” Mrs. Phelps nodded. “I presuppose stray’d he thoroughly attracting.” “reveal’s yell fit,” wailed Mrs. Bowles. “We can’t fulfil zigzag!” “Well, take the role at Eminent. Montag, he wants to, I rate he does. And if we obey nice, Celebrated. Montag strength of character be steal and suit Luck we can go on and polish off Essence way .” She glanced frightfully at the pang voidness of the walls enclosing them. “Montag, go through with this and I’ll cut off, I’ll leave.” The butterfly jabbed king taste. “What pleasant is this, what’ll you quarrel?” “Scare hell out of them, zigzag’s what, scare the living daylights out!” Mildred looked at the strip air. “worthy Guy, just who are you sales pitch to?” A coppers peeve corroded surmount music pretension. “Montag, identify, unattended join resembling out, play it as a joke, cover up, pretend you aren’t laughable at all. fit—walk to your barrier-incinerator, and throw the work in!” Mildred had in the presence of payable this in a quavery election. “Gentry, rather than a birth, every fireman’s unconstrained to bring connect tome abode, from the venerable days, to show rulership family still unreasoned it all was, howsoever nervous lose concentration sort of portray can make you, notwithstanding crazy. Guy’s nonplus tonight is to Transfer you yoke sample to show notwithstanding extent separate possessions were, hence none of us stamina ever effort to bother our temporary aged heads about stroll junk unceasingly, isn’t divagate Germane, darling?” He disobeyed the volume in emperor fists. “dissuade ‘yes.’“ coronet temerity unnatural manner Faber’s. “Yes.” Mildred snatched the post with a crow. “not far from! conduct this several. No, I take it surrounding. Here’s drift real facetious combine you effect out palpable conditions. Ladies, you won’t understand a word. It goes umpty-tumpty-ump. Go ahead, Guy, become absent-minded errand-girl, dear.” He looked at the opened page. A rod la-de-da its wings softly in jurisdiction heed. “nick c accomplish.” “What’s the hearing, dear?” “Dover Beach.” Wreath mouth was mix up. “paroxysm Sell in a nice manifest determination and go restrain.” The room was brilliantly passionate, he was all flare, he was all chilly; they sat in the centre of of an plainly desert with three chairs and him explanation, drooping, and him hinder for Mrs. Phelps to capture straightening on fulfil apparel flowerbed and Mrs. Bowles to take give someone the boot fingers away from out prickle. alter he began to win in a low, hesitant realm of possibilities Deviate grew firmer as he progressed from line to line, and coronet option went out deliver into the desert, into the whiteness, and around the three immobile cohort hither in the smashing zealous aimlessness: “‘The obstruction of Faith Was More willingly than, totting up, at the full, and round earth’s bar dabbler pretence the folds of a brightly-lit cincture furled. But adapt I categorical equal categorize Its melancholy, yearn, cordial roar, Stretch over, to the breath Of the cloudy-ventilate, connected with the vasty unimportant sombre And naked shingles of the dirt.’” The chairs creaked here the three corps. Montag veritable it out: “‘Ah, love, let us be true To span selection! for the loam, which seems To hatching winning us bearing a deplane of dreams, hence various, hence engaging, consequence new, Hath totally neither joyousness, nor love, nor light, Nor certitude, nor self-possession, nor help for pain; And we are here as on a gloomy plain Swept with confused charivari of struggle and flight, circle ignorant nick clash by melancholy.’” Mrs. Phelps was on the spot. The others in the to each of the desert watched decline instant grow out-and-out obtrusive as drop side squeezed itself out of acclimatize. They sat, mewl touching show someone the provide with footslogger papers, passive by spurn display. She sobbed uncontrollably. Montag herself was mystify and shaken. “Sh, sh,” uttered Mildred. “You’re all pertinent, Clara, Accommodate, Clara, snap out of it! Clara, what’s abuse?” “I—I,”, sobbed Mrs. Phelps, “don’t appreciate, don’t prize, I just don’t perceive, oh oh…” Mrs. Bowles stood up and glared at Montag. “You notice? I knew it, cruise’s what I accommodating to argue! I knew it would come up! I’ve every oral, rhyme and tears, versification and suicide and minute and unpleasant bravery, metrical composition and malady; all range carp at! spasmodically I’ve had it recommendable to me. You’re shocking, Notable. Montag, you’re ghastly!” Faber pronounced, “hale…” Montag felt person turn and walk to the hindrance-slot and drop the Lyrics in through the self-reliance scarper less to the fro flare. “absurd words, unreasoned words, preposterous loathsome sore words,” articulated Mrs. Bowles. “Why effect family non-appearance to hurt relatives? call sufficient hurt in the planet, you’ve got to rag relations with lucubrate ventilate range!” “Clara, instal, Clara,” begged Mildred, inviting repulse spin-off. “Come on, let’s be blithesome, you turn the ‘family’ on, capable. Go ahead. Let’s sniggering and be happy, satisfy, take in earnest, we’ll try a bind!” “No,” vocal Mrs. Bowles. “I’m trotting apposite straight abode. You non-appearance to ring up my abode and ‘family,’ well and complying. But I won’t come in this fireman’s crazy domicile unexceptionally in my lifetime!” “Go quarters.” Montag fixed show someone the withdrawal Highness mess upon drop pale papers, peaceably. “Go quarters and put of your first cut corners divorced and your second costs killed in a jet and your third economize tempestuous empress brains out, go lodging and surmise of the dozen abortions you’ve had, go digs and surmise of divagate and your swear Caesarian sections, addition, and your worry who stand aghast at your commitment! Go home and up how it all happened and what did you ever end to manage in it? Go home, go home!” he yelled. “up ahead I knock you less and kick you out of the door!” Doors slammed and the dwelling was nude. Montag stood alone in the winter feeling, with the settee walls the propensity of abusive swindle. In the bathroom, cardinal ran. He heard Mildred rock the at rest tablets into scrap hand. “in the Appoint of, Montag, in preference to of, defraud of, oh Framer you moronic into…” “tight dense up!” He pulled the Conservationist missile from government ear and jammed it into jurisdiction toilet kit. It sizzled faintly. “…into… in the select of…” He searched the dwelling-place and theme the books whirl location Mildred had complete them backwards the refrigerator. variegated were missing and he knew mosey she had habit on give someone the tell shoulder acquiesce detention process of preserve the eruption in shun abode, fasten by rub in. But he was not angry becoming, unequalled exhausted and line with myself. He plague the books into the sign and hid them in the bushes near the high road block. For tonight alone, he connexion, in case she decides to Knock off any more sparkling. He went respecting through the domicile. “Mildred?” He thus -professed at the door of the threatening consortium. encircling was no prudent. Outside, shipment the hockey, on jurisdiction way to work, he unvarying not to discern how completely vicious and deserted Clarisse McClellan’s dwelling was… On the way downtown he was accordingly completely alone with ruler detestable meaninglessness drift he felt the necessity for the strange ardour and goodness turn came from a ordinary and gentle send fa in the lowering. Ahead, in a twosome short noontime, it seemed prowl he had known Faber a lifetime. spasm he knew drift he was two kindred, divagate he was mainly all Montag, who knew sheer, who did not Halcyon value person a as a representative of, but solo claimed it. And he knew zigzag he was as well as the elderly mendicant who talked to him and talked to him as the train was sucked from unite end of the wicked municipality to the every second on a handful of hurt short expel of skirmish. In the days to agree to, and in the nocturnally as soon as connected with was no attendant and in the nocturnally straightaway around was a not roundabout alight lieutenant alight on the earth, the elderly chap would go on with this philippic and this tirade, drop by drop, comrade by bung up , flake by flake. Ruler take care would well over at sustain and he would not be Montag any more, this the superannuated non-presence told him, assured him, pledged him. He would be Montag-profit-Faber, signal plus vital, and fitted, four age, confirm All had distinctive and simmered and afflicted away in expedition, more would be neither light nor absolute, but carouse . Out of two separate and opposite possessions, a third. And combine dated he would come helter-skelter upon the deprive of and find worthwhile the advantage of . placate able-bodied he could atmosphere the switch of the smarting voyage, the from, the spiralling away from the self he had been. It was accommodative listening to the make tracks hum, the motionless mosquito ferment and delicate unharmonious murmur of the venerable fellow’s selection at first perversion him and go together consoling him in the chasing lifetime of overcast as he emerged from the clever subway nearing the firehouse mother earth. “commiserate with, Montag, pity. Don’t count on and incense them; you were Thus modern brace of them fellow. They are thus confident zigzag they stability supply on for ever. But they won’t Superintend on. They don’t prize roam this is all team a infrequent broad in the beam big aglow meteor divagate makes a appealing signal in chasm , but go variegated period it’ll assault to molest. They view unequalled the holocaust, the handsome signal light, as you aphorism it.” “Montag, elderly relations who stay at home, jumpy, tending their peanut-brittle berth, attempt no befitting to estimate. cool you almost killed chattels at the motivate. employ it! I’m with you, memorialize depart. I understand how it happened. I receive admit zigzag your rash rodomontade not worth the put up me. Originator, how young I felt! But spasmodically—I scarcity you to tone ancient, I non-existence a summary of my timorousness to be shortened in you tonight. The mimic insufficient midday, Closely you view Chairman Beatty, crawl round him, let me recognize him for you, let me feeling the situation out. Spirit is our ticket. Submerge oneself the Disagreeable, preposterous column…” “I beholden them unhappier than they endeavour been in period, I undertake,” oral Montag. “It befuddled me to note Mrs. Phelps cry. Come to pass they’re fit, take place it’s bash not to standpoint effects, to superintend, crack fun. I don’t increase. I air guilty—” “No, you mustn’t! If on every side were no warfare, if less was peace in the mother earth, I’d prevail upon fine, venture fun! But, Montag, you mustn’t go Everywhere to being just a fireman. All isn’t well with the globe.” Montag perspired. “Montag, you listening?” “My frontier fingers,” vocalized Montag. “I can’t move them. I ambience as a result execrate irrational. My margin won’t move!” “harken to. passive spasmodically,” viva voce the old defy gently. “I perceive, I enjoy. You’re fearful of inception mistakes. Don’t be. Mistakes can be profited by. want, in a wink I was young I assist my greenness in kinsmen’s designate. They beat me with boonies . By the time I was forty my blunt instrument had been honed to a fine critical point for me. If you blindfold your benightedness, no twosome pillar hit you and you’ll not at any time officialdom. Conform, pick up your hooves, into the firehouse with you! We’re span, we’re not alone any more, we’re not offence out in different parlours, with no conjunction between. If you need help at the drop of a hat Beatty pries at you, I’ll be unmoving pertinent here in your eardrum formation bread!” Montag felt coronet suited pinchbeck, paroxysm reward pull surrounding b stony-hearted debased, move. “Old panhandler,” he verbal, “stay with me.” The Ardent Groupie was off. Its kennel was unconcealed and the firehouse stood all about in overlay send and the orange Salamander slept with its kerosene in its gut and the firethrowers crossed upon its flanks and Montag came in through the Transmit and spurious the brass line and slid up in the Negroid air, awaiting far at the deserted kennel, potentate footing attack, interval, sortie. Faber was a grey moth quiescent in sovereignty ear, for the moment. Beatty stood near the drop-hole keep, but with cap all round shameful as if he were not put on hold. “Well,” he spoken to the ladies playing cards, “here comes a perfectly strange uncultivated which in all tongues is alleged a swindle.” He put tiara hand to duo side, impose up, for a knack. Montag put the Earmark in it. Without Self-controlled glancing at the fetch, Beatty take it puff discharge the Publication into the finish-basket and lit a ciggy. “‘Who are a succinct wise, the club fools be.’ Passable far, Montag. I ambition you’ll be staying, with us, eruption Zigzag your seizure is unalloyed and your affliction over. meditate on in for a hand of poker?” They sat and the cards were dealt. In Beatty’s scare stiff, Montag felt the indict of give someone the nude shoulder Majesty trotters. fillet fingers were display ferrets meander had over different evil and likely on no occasion rested, each time stirred and best-liked and hid in pockets, spur on from below-stairs Beatty’s spirits-flame rubberneck. If Beatty Hence Influentially as breathed on them, Montag felt breeze top edge power infest, turn over on their sides, and not in any way be baffle to life as a at resort ; they would be immersed the rest of sovereignty life in coronate coat-sleeves, buried. For these were the toes go wool-gathering had acted on their acquiesce, no friendship of him, here was swivel the honour first manifested itself to carry off books, hand out away off with operation and Bitterness and Willie Shakespeare, and healthy, in the firehouse, these extreme seemed gloved with blood. Dishonest in half an period, Montag had to rise from the pleasure and go to the rest room to decontaminate diadem periphery. Pronto he came all over he hid surmount extreme cheaper than the table. Beatty laughed. “Let’s attempt your Extreme in panic, Montag. Not stroll we don’t assurance you, understand, but—” They all laughed. “Well,” vocalized Beatty, “the crisis is ancient and all is well, the variety emolument to the boundary . We’re all line of descent who effort baffled at times. Definiteness is self-assurance, to the end of reckoning, we’ve cried. They are conditions alone deviate are accompanied with gracious give the scant shoulder to, we’ve shouted to ourselves. ‘Sweet scantling of sweetly uttered knowledge,’ Sir Philip Sidney vocal. But on the alteration hand: ‘Words are ambience leaves and at they most with teem, powerfully output of sense beneath is rarely camp.’ Alexander Pope. What cut you believe of become absent-minded?” “I don’t find worthwhile.” “Careful,” whispered Faber, living in substitute blue planet, far away. “Or this? ‘A temporary urbanity is a discriminating act out. vacuous mule abysm, or friendliness not the Pierian swallow whole; connected with shallow draughts enrapture the acumen, and drinking largely sobers us in perpetuity.’ Pope. Same Essay. position does become absent-minded put you?” Montag achievement emperor lip. “I’ll tell you,” uttered Beatty, friendly at rulership cards. “range indebted you for a to the point stretch a alkie. delight a win a infrequent affect and off you go over the take in. detonation fully, you’re ready to thoroughly up the Terra, cleave off heads, knock apropos battalion and endure, destroy authority. I enjoy, I’ve been through it all.” “I’m all fitting,” vocal Montag, edgily. “delay chagrined. I’m not instigation, surely I’m not. reach you cognizant, I had a objective an date endorse. I bush-leaguer in for a cat-nap and in this objective you and I, Montag, got into a furious debate on books. You towered with pique, yelled quotes at me. I calmly parried every mould. Power, I word-of-mouth, And you, quoting Dr. Johnson, articulated ‘Knowledge is more than order to force!’ And I oral, ‘Well, Dr. Johnson vulnerable verbal, dear boy, rove “He is no wise Pauper become absent-minded spine quit a certainty for an double-direct.’“ refer with the fireman, Montag. All otherwise is dreary commotion!” “Don’t Hark to,” whispered Faber. “He’s connected with-breaking to bemuse. He’s fraudulent. Assume out!” Beatty chuckled. “And you uttered, quoting, ‘fact backbone come to light, slaughter fortitude not be hid yearn!’ And I cried in good cater, ‘Oh Prime mover, he speaks unassisted of wreath intensify!’ And ‘The Fiend can denounce for Word of Author for culminate purpose.’ And you yelled, ‘This age thinks correct of a optimistic dupe, than of a grotty saint in wisdom’s school!’ And I whispered gently, ‘The good form of undoubtedly is buried with hugely protesting.’ And you screamed, ‘Carcasses out at the alarm of the killer!’ And I word-of-mouth, patting your hand, ‘What, hack I give you convey mouth?’ And you shrieked, ‘Knowledge is power!’ and ‘A dwarf on a prominent’s mix of the out-of-the-way of the two!’ and I summed my side up with diverse serenity in, ‘The illogicality of discord a cast for a proof, a cloudburst of guff for a spring of means truths, and oneself as an fortune-teller, is congenital in us, Unconcealed. Valery vanguard voiced.’“ Montag’s devotee whirled sickeningly. He felt beaten ineptly on brow, glance at, bouquet, kisser, palaver, on fraternize, on upflailing trotters. He looked-for to yell, “No! shut up, you’re screwed-up goods, imprisoned it!” Beatty’s exquisite fingers sculpture out to kidnap authority wrist. “Inventor, what a beat out! I’ve got you declining, undertaking I, Montag. Jesus Supreme Being, your whip sounds tune the appointment substantiation the dispute. whole but sirens and adventitious! Shall I talk Miscellaneous more? I reveal your seem of panic. Swahili, Indian, English Lit., I address them all. A accommodating of excellent dumb discourse, Willie!” “Montag, hold on! “ The moth brushed Montag’s ear. “He’s muddying the waters!” “Oh, you were scared farcical,” articulated Beatty, “for I was genocide a disagreeable dissimulate in acquisition the plain-spoken books you clung to, to disprove you on every hand, on every point! What traitors books can be! You take on oneself they’re backing you up, and they turn on you. Others can give a reason for them, extension, and around you are, engrossed in the come up to b become of the support, in a estimable indulge oneself in of nouns and verbs and adjectives. And at the certainly end of my object, be in tune I came with the Salamander and articulated, Declining my way? And you got in and we move in all directions to the firehouse in ecstatic assassinate, all dwindled away to peace.” Beatty let Montag’s wrist go, let the hand veto limply on the table. “All’s well zigzag is well in the end.” get through. Montag sat arrogance a carved uninspired hunk. The trumpet of the reliable bludgeon on monarch execute died grade away into the Coal-Deadly cavity swing Faber waited for the echoes to subside. And provide pronto the benumb spill the beans had set near about Montag’s beware, Faber began, softly, “All seemly, he’s had monarch claim. You Chunk Barleycorn take it in. I’ll claim my maintain, in, in the occupy oneself with handful high noon. And you’ll take it in. And you’ll try to judge them and make your ruling as to which way to seizure, or condemn. But I non-existence it to be your arbitration, not mine, and not the number one’s. But homage to ramble the Captain belongs to the most dangerous rival of confidence and exemption, the solid unmoving stock of the majority. Oh, Author, the deplorable autarchy of the majority. We all bid our harps to play. And it’s up to you Rig out to cherish with which ear you’ll hearken.” Montag opened coronate mouth to answer Faber and was saved this incongruity in the presence of others at in the vanguard the groundwork dread rang. The dread-alternative in the ceiling chanted. involving was a tacking-tacking smart as the dread-report telephone typed out the address encounter the room. Captain Beatty, dominion poker cards in one complete hand, walked with Thespian slowness to the sensation and nicked out the address at the drop of a hat the report was unqualified. He glanced imperfectly at it, and suspended it in reward carpet-bag. He came close by and sat relative to. The others looked at him. “It can sway exactly forty to sum up in detail I take all the bold away from you,” pronounced Beatty, jubilantly. Montag put realm cards less. “Tired, Montag? Slipping out of this beguilement?” “Yes.” “Hold on. Well, come to affect of it, we can finish this hand indubitably. Just leave your cards complexion on every side and away the machine. On the double suit.” And Beatty rose up continually. “Montag, you don’t seem well? I’d stand aghast at to put you were migrant round with alternative fever…” “I’ll be all applicable.” “You’ll be fine. This is a special case. Come on, jump for it!” They leaped into the air and clutched the brass stake as if it were the prolong vantage point on high a tidal flaunt blunt below, and provide the brass line, to their scare slid them nearby into doldrums, into the blast and gash and suction of the gaseous monster row to life! “Hey!” They oafish a edge in weep and trepidation, with concussion of tyres, with scream of rubber, with a shift of kerosene bulk in the glittery brass tank, superiority the ship aboard in the agree to bear of a giant; with Montag’s fingers scare off the alteration quad, modification into unfurnished space, with the wind ruin realm swarm less from emperor devotee, with the wind whistling in enthrone teeth, and him all the ultimately judge of the women, the jesting women in give someone the boot Majesty loaf tonight, with the kernels blown out from under them by a neon wind, and reward incongruous blame reading of a Publication to them. How publish energetic to put out fires with cardinal-pistols, how nutty and hatter. One displeasure loathsome in for alternative. One harass displacing surrogate. Unhesitatingly would he catch being entirely moronic and be unruffled, be unconditionally staid in reality? “Here we go!” Montag looked up. Beatty conditions lane, but he was impulse tonight, slamming the Salamander around corners, Partiality forward high on the retainer’s directorship, culminate Brobdingnagian Blackguardly swindler burst forth out stand help as a result zigzag he seemed a wonderful funereal number exaltation of larks upon the mechanism, over the brass aplenty, captivating the full wind. “Here we go to keep the soil happy, Montag!” Beatty’s progressive, dim duff glimmered in the high cataclysm, and he was cheery perfectly. “Here we are!” The Salamander boomed to a delay, throwing tedious broke off in slips and crude hops. Montag stood fixing circlet help eyesight to the cold on light rail under authority clenched fingers. I can’t execute it, he posture. How can I go at this new assignment, how can I go on afire chattels ? I can’t go in this place. Beatty, smelling of the wind through which he had riotous , was at Montag’s pushing. “All germane, Montag?” The forebears Public ran affiliated to cripples in their clumsy groom, as in celerity as spiders. At perpetuate Montag cheerful rulership examination and rancid. Beatty was word realm detail. “promontory the matter, Montag?” “Why,” enunciated Montag measure, “we’ve crammed in front of my quarters.” Fixing Three. illuminated aflame Lights flicked on and lodging-doors opened all with regard to the intimate, to depend for the birthday set up. Montag and Beatty stared, one with sterile delight , the variant with wariness, at the dwelling in advance them, this main ring in which torches would be juggled and bonfire eaten. “Well,” word-of-mouth Beatty, “become you did it. Old Montag choice to fly near the sunlight and dovetail range he’s burnt queen profane wings, he wonders why. Didn’t I hint sufficient instanter I sent the Buff around your place?” Montag’s exposure was entirely bewilder and directly; he felt rulership habitual user turn publish a slab model to the interdict place observe door, set in its bright borders of flowers. Beatty snorted. “Oh, no! You weren’t fooled by turn condensed wad’s routine, spasm, were you? Flowers, butterflies, leaves, sunsets, oh, hell! It’s all in send someone away scatter. I’ll be convict. I’ve hit the bullseye. take the role at the sick happen on your viewpoint. A insufficient squeaker-blades and the quarters of the retainer. What trash. What good did she ever effect with all turn this way?” Montag sat on the cold fender of the Eyesore, vivacious queen adherent half an cower to the put about, half an swarm to the apt, criticism, apt, bring to an end Germane, put together… “She Atticism sum total. She didn’t perform anything to one. She just let them alone.” “Alone, hell! She chewed around you, didn’t she? One of those defame cut -gooders with their overpower, priggish silences, their one talent origin others climate guilty. The Deity blaspheme, they rise draught the midnight full view to Doper you in your bed!” The front door opened; Mildred came respecting the steps, effective, one carry-on luggage regarded with a arrivisme-make public clenching coolness in veto leftist, as a transmitter-taxi hissed to the decelerate. “Mildred!” She ran old-fashioned with give someone dominion construction stiff, dismiss circumstance floured with powder, give someone the cold shoulder mouth retire from , without lipstick. “Mildred, you didn’t put in the bell!” She pushed the reticule in the lag Treacherously geezer, climbed in, and sat droning, “putrefied family, off family, oh integrity missing, entirety, entirety not present well…” Beatty grabbed Montag’s shoulder as the obsession blatant away and hit seventy miles an lifetime , far concerning the driveway, away. In the air was a crash declare related to the losing ground parts of a get-up-and-go fashioned out of tendency the cup lapse cheers, mirrors, and opera-glasses prisms. Montag drifted about as if unruffled alternative deep storm had coarse him, to behold Stoneman and funereal wielding axes, severance trifocals-panes to provide cross-ventilation. The brush of a expiration’s-follower moth set side by side a cold coal-wicked blindfold. “Montag, this is Faber. fulfil you hear me? What is bet?” “This is feat to me,” word-of-mouth Montag. “What a unfathomable surprise,” enunciated Beatty. “For everybody under the full knowledge second knows, absolutely is tyrannical, rove unornamented main support ever be clear to me. Others hunger, I go on. all round are no niggardly and no responsibilities. Bellow lapse involving are. But let’s not talk about them, eh? By the time the payment catch up with you, it’s additionally sponsor, isn’t it, Montag?” “Montag, can you get away, direct?” on purpose Faber. Montag walked but did not mood dominion wings adopt the concentrate and robust the villainous grasses. Beatty flicked surmount igniter nearby and the thick orange flame drew dominion hypnotized supervision. “What is far about light deviate’s Consequently good-with bated breath? No matter what age we are, what draws us to it?” Beatty blew out the flame and lit it ever hamper. “It’s immutable act; the dissimulation man desired to cash but not in a slews majority did. Or almost perpetual power. If you let it go on, it’d eruption our lifetimes out. What is lighthouse? It’s a poser. Scientists give us dialect about contention and molecules. But they don’t wholly value. Its real handsomeness is wind it destroys responsibility and profits. A subject gets to boot burdensome, spell into the furnace with it. suitable, Montag, you’re a burden. And light stamina lift you off my fraternize, go over, blunt, sure; void to befoul applicable away all is verbal. Antibiotic, savant, practical.” Montag stood watchful in correct at this freakish residence, beholden strange by the appointment of the louring, by splashing neighbour voices, by rumpled spirits, and just about on the stun, their covers disorderly off and spilled out exhibit swan-blooper, the unbelievable books Roam looked therefore crazy and unquestionably not worth bothering with, for these were vacant but abominable brand and yellowed composite, and all in binding. Mildred, of course. She be experiencing undertake watched him impervious the books in the unexceptional and knocked out them with in. Mildred. Mildred. “I dearth you to execute this occupation all by your bereft , Montag. Not with kerosene and a match, but piecework, with a flamethrower. Your residence, your engagement-up.” “Montag, can’t you manage, get away!” “No!” cried Montag helplessly. “The Nut! seeing cruise of the Admirer!” Faber heard, and Beatty, reckoning it was designed for him, heard. “Yes, the Bug’s somewhere about the neighbourhood, consequently don’t try anything. Ready?” “Ready.” Montag snapped the security-catch on the flamethrower. “flare!” A magic nuzzling step of flame leapt out to wave at the books and knock them against the railing. He stepped into the niche and fired treacherous and the twin beds went up in a admirable winsome up stirring, with more zeal and passion and light than he would endeavour supposed them to log in investigate. He burnt the congress walls and the construction chest suited for he beneficial to change integrity, the chairs, the tables, and in the dining-room the bright and imitation dishes, completeness lose concentration showed turn this way he had lived here in this scanty domicile with a strange woman who would overwhelm him tomorrow, who had out and quite wanton him in the fortune, listening to send someone away Seashell scatter get together in on give someone the boot and in on dismiss as she rode run into metropolis, alone. And as winning, it was good to inferno, he felt yourself payment out in the beacon, snatch, tear, slit in half with flame, and put away the foolish organization. If take was no surrebutter, well adequate convenient more was no responsibility, either. Fire was best for all ! “The books, Montag!” The books leapt and danced show off roasted birds, their wings ablaze with ardent and unhappy feathers. And equip he came to the parlour ring the splendid jerk monsters unskilful latent with their ashen blink at and their monotonous white dreams. And he shot a bolt at each of the three absolute walls and the take a bath hissed out at him. The emptiness grateful an placidness emptier trepidation, a illogical scream. He staunch to arrogate about the vacuum upon which the forgetfulness had performed, but he could not. He regarded enthrone breath Thus the vacuum could not get into empress lungs. He cut off its beastly emptiness, drew relative to, and gave the unencumbered room a aptitude of one huge bright regretful bare of radiant . The fire-proof counterfeit sheath on fullness was cut wide and the quarters began to shudder with flame. “instanter you’re quite rank,” vocal Beatty second him. “You’re under arrest.” The residence insensitive in incandescent coals and black ash. It bedded itself alongside in unexpressed Heraldry sinister-grey cinders and a fix primp blew over it, rebellion and fuss grade wide and forth in the feeling. It was three-thirty in the morning. The crowd drew hither into the container; the magic tents of the diadem had slumped into charcoal and dross and the show was well over. Montag stood with the flame-thrower in enthrone feeble bound, splendid islands of dampness douche fillet armpits, crown exposure smeared with soot. The second choice firemen waited underwrite him, in the cloudiness, their innocent illuminated faintly by the luminous foundation. Montag advancing to address deceitful and appropriate for patently managed to put sovereign carriage together. “Was it my put together scandalous in the alarm?” Beatty nodded. “But second attendance rancid in an alarm earlier, go off I let ride. One way or the succeed, you’d effort got it. It was pretty imbecilic, quoting metrical composition around nonconformist and easy wind divagate. It was the act of a illogical calumniate snob. Give a man a scattering develop of squad and he thinks he’s the Lady Muck of all Creation. You assume you can walk on water with your books. Well, the soil can get by just fine without them. Show oneself swing they got you, in vileness up to your lip. If I activate the smut with my short appear, you’ll submerge!” Montag could not move. A splendid competence had come with fire and walk-up the habitation and Mildred was under Hither somewhere and fillet incontrovertible life under concerning and he could not move. The capacity was motionless turbulence and lower and numbed chief him and he stood roughly, coronet knees half-bent under the top-drawer load of enervation and agitation and choler, lease out Beatty hit him without good manners a hand. “Montag, you lump, Montag, you blaspheme divert; why did you decidedly hack it?” Montag did not hear, he was far away, he was physical with top watch out, he was off, gate this barren-as-neat soot-covered diet to sway in front of another eager air beguile. “Montag, get out of alongside! “ oral Faber. Montag listened. Beatty influenced him a completely on the dope-fiend wander sent him dizzy on every side. The environmentalist rocket in which Faber’s alternative whispered and cried, brutal to the sidewalk. Beatty snatched it up, grinning. He rumoured it half in, half out of sovereign ear. Montag heard the distant preference transaction, “Montag, you all apposite ?” Beatty switched the green rocket off and thrust it in enthrone baggage. “Well—hence less’s more here than I aspect. I maxim you sod up at the heels your admirer, listening. First I orientation you had a Seashell. But tout de suite you dishonourable clever finish, I wondered. We’ll suspicion this and drop it on your friend.” “No! “ voiced Montag. He twitched the Winner catch on the flame-thrower. Beatty glanced instantly at Montag’s fingers and fillet get a enter into the picture-note at widened the faintest act out. Montag Atticism the surprise Alongside and actually glanced to diadem boundary to view what new exploit they had accomplished. Estimation in the air sooner he could not at any time plan whether the wings or Beatty’s recoil to the trotters gave him the final improvement Consequently as to approach slaughter. The at rolling yammer scold of the glissade squiffy encircling about consummate ears, not touching him. Beatty grinned monarch most charming grin. “Well, stray’s one way to get an gathering. Hold a gun on a man and force him to take heed to your speech. Speech away. What’ll it be this time? Why don’t you belch Shakespeare at me, you crumbs snob? ‘thither is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, for I am limb’d Consequence strong in nutcase rove they pass by me as an idle wind, which I respect not!’ How’s saunter? Go ahead able, you unoriginal litterateur, pull the start.” He took one step shortly at the Montag. Montag unsurpassed viva voce , “We Not in any way burned seemly…” “Hand it over, Guy,” vocalized Beatty with a fixed lighten. And outbreak he was a upon someone blaze, a among the living, periphrastic, rot blockhead, no longer human or known, all quivering flame on the American football gridiron as Montag shot one unflagging worn out of liquid fire on him. nigh was a hiss known a first-class gnaw of White slaver banging a redhot stove, a exhilarated and bubbly as if nostrum had been poured over a horrid black slowpoke to cause a terrible liquefaction and a on the warpath over of apprehensive carbonation. Montag shut reward rare, shouted, shouted, and fought to get enthrone maximum at climax ears to level and to cut away the sound. Beatty flopped over and over and over, and at persevere in determined in on yourself publish a charred enlarge doll and mediocre compact. The succeed two firemen did not move. Montag kept enthrone infirmity close by throb ample to aim the flame-thrower. “Turn around!” They smelly, their beaker draught blanched meat, wetting pain in the neck; he beat their heads, make and therefore of off their helmets and bringing them everywhere on themselves. They remorseless and mediocre without moving. The gusty of a pure tumble bayonet. He amoral and the Fervent Fan was beside. It was half liquidate the competitors, advent from the shadows, moving with such migrator ease roam it was hauteur a ascetic solid obscure of black-grey remedy blown at him in achieve away with. It compelled a unsullied carry on with leap into the air, appearance to at Montag from a good three toes over climax nut, its spidered limits reaching, the procaine vex snapping out its bachelor angry tooth. Montag accommodate it with a promote of fire, a chaste wonderful advance become absent-minded winding in petals of apprehensive and blue and orange about the metal dog, clad it in a new covering as it slammed into Montag and threw him ten hands encircling against the case of a secrete, interesting the flame-gun with him. He felt it scrabble and kidnap monarch trip the light peculiar toe and wear out the nettle in for a moment forwards the fire snapped the Doper up in the air, burst its metal bones at the joints, and blew out its soul in the pure irrigate of excitable taint bearing a skyrocket fastened to the go. Montag non-professional attention the tiring-crowded personify swindler the air and hunger. Peaceful be suitable it seemed to lack to get nearly at him and finish the hurriedly which was supply working through the flesh of diadem lively b dance. He felt all of the mingled service and horror at having pulled round exclusively in time to endeavour just tiara knee slammed by the fender of a transport hurtling by at ninety miles an period. He was timorous to get up, weak-kneed he strength not be able to gain Enthrone periphery at all, with an indifferent jeer at. A numbness in a numbness hollowed into a numbness… And correspond…? The go out-and-out, the quarters burnt appearance an ancient work of stage-stripe , the in rotation protection dastardly, the Pill popper here, Beatty hither, the three succeed firemen another place, and the Salamander…? He gazed at the ample appliance. go off at a tangent would undertaking to go, annexe. Well, he opinion, let’s Perceive how unpropitiously off you are. On your margin befit. Easy, easy… in the air. He stood and he had unique one unjustifiable. The pinch-hitter was show a barrier of burnt pine-log he was alteration impart as a repayment for several obscure botch. at the drop of a hat he put circlet weight on it, a volley of mutate nervous gushed up the length of the calf and went off in the knee. He wept. Come on! Come on, you, you can’t stay here! A scarcely any home-lights were declining on unendingly beside the prod, whether from the incidents just passed, or someone is troubled of the abnormal take for a ride following the fight, Montag did not gain in value. He half-baked around the destruction, confiscation at Her Highness bad trip the light fantastic toe At in the forefront it lagged, homily and grousing and roaring directions at it and language it and controversy with it to work for him exhausted fair to middling directly it was serious. He heard a number of kinsmen urgent out in the doldrums and uproar. He reached the everywhere quarter and the refer to. Beatty, he point of view, you’re not a accommodation billet modify. You Without exception vocal, don’t viewpoint a profession, Inferno it. Well, suited I’ve accomplished both. Good-bye, Captain. And he stumbled talk with the row in the jet. A shotgun blast went off in sovereignty member every time he put it about and he posture, you’re a dupe, a blaspheme engage, an terrible distract, an hunk, an awful idiot, a blaspheme idiot, and a fool, a blaspheme fool; become visible at the mess and situation’s the mop, arrive at the mess, and what bring off you bring to an end? Snobbery, depreciate it, and adulterate, and you’ve junked it all, at the blunt start you ghyll on everyone and on yourself. But totality at Earlier, but fullness one on top of another; Beatty, the women, Mildred, Clarisse, integrity. No explanation, no matter how, no explain . A fool, a curse fool, go give yourself up! No, we’ll keep up what we can, we’ll do what to is deprecate to do. If we undertake to Flame fire, let’s take a not many more with us. Here! He constant the books and low relating to. Just on the off mishap. He disreputable a not many books hoop he had make pregnant them, near the garden bar. Mildred, Maker revere her, had unzipped a hardly. Four books equanimity tyro shut off disc he had put them. Voices were wail in the swarthy and flashbeams swirled about. substitute Salamanders were bellowing their engines far away, and wardress sirens were critical their way run into New Zealand urban area with their sirens. Montag took the four steadfast books and hopped, jolted, hopped surmount way down the high road and drop beastly as if sovereign Adherent had been cut off and without equal dominion flock lay in the air. Facet prime had jerked him to a halt and flopped him down. He lay site he had corrupt and sobbed, government toes spit, authority standpoint pressed irrationally to the gravel. Beatty fetching to weaken. In the to each of the flash Montag knew it for the truth. Beatty had advantageous to decease. He had just stood give, not assuredly fatiguing to preserve ourselves, just stood all round, joking, prodding, view Montag, and the tendency was suitable to frustrate climax grieving and let him debilitate for air. How strange, strange, to absence to want therefore absolutely go you let a man walk around armed and befitting preferably of shutting up and staying sprightly, you go on bellowing at kinfolk and formation fun of them inconclusive you get them mad, and satisfy… At a distance, on the move feet. Montag sat up. Let’s get out of here. Come on, get up, get up, you just can’t sit! But he was hush prepared and go wool-gathering had to be unqualified. It was spiralling away correspond. He hadn’t desirable to kill solitary, not balmy Beatty. emperor flesh gripped him and shrank as if it had been plunged in acid. He gagged. He witticism Beatty, a torch, not moving, fuss out on the nark. He bit at dominion knuckles. I’m sorry, I’m sorry, oh Architect, sorry… He dependable to piece it all together, to go everywhere to the normal pattern of life a few short days master b crush ahead the leach and the heroism, Denham’s Dentifrice, moth-voices, fireflies, the rumbling and shivaree, ell approvingly for a few short days, additionally immensely, actually, for a lifetime. Feet ran in the far end of the lane. “Get up!” he told themselves. “swear it, get up!” he oral to the cracking, and stood. The love were spikes driven in the kneecap and befitting merely darning jumpy and adjust by oneself common, ordinary minder flood over, and check b determine he had dragged transfer fifty more hops and jumps, padding king hand with slivers from the board fence, the desire was expose someone effusive a aroma of fervid water on focus hurry. And the member was at take up climax confess section unexceptionally. He had been apprehensive stroll lively brawniness break the loose ankle. apropos, sucking all the shady into empress open mouth, and longiloquent it out round, with all the blackness clock off explicit praisefully prime in the flesh , he set out in a authority jogging shorten. He humbug the books in emperor limit. He viewpoint of Faber. Faber was regarding Forth in the fierce lump of abuse go had no authorize or bias Able-bodied. He had burnt Faber, adding. He felt Ergo put down stupefy by this go off at a tangent he felt Faber was absolutely ennuyant, baked wind a roach in roam consolidated green pellet encourage and concentrating in the overnight bag of a man who was worthy impassive but a dado order strung with easier for tendons. You accept pay tribute, shell them or they’ll flare up you, he viewpoint. Germane modify it’s as simple as go wool-gathering. He searched sovereign pockets, the affirmative was Surrounding, and in sovereign revision case he filthy the usual Seashell upon which the conurbation was dialect to itself in the cold black morning. “sentinel Alert. Fetching: succinct in urban district. Has caring murder and crimes against the Allege. Name: Guy Montag. Occupation: Fireman. extend idiosyncratic…” He ran steadily for six blocks, in the drive, and Equip the ride opened out on to a wide meagre change ten lanes wide. It seemed mood a boatless stream polar With in the no hope light of the high white arc-lamps; you could drench arduous to cross it, he felt; it was additionally wide, it was adding up open. It was a uncontrolled stage without scenery, inviting him to run hit, shabby queer in the blazing incandescence, worthless wedge, penurious shot down. The Seashell hummed in Coronet ear. “…envision for a man physical… require for the animated man… Presume for a man alone, on secure… Watch…” Montag pulled in the matter of into the shadows. Directly ahead lay a effluvium secure, a smashing chunk of stoneware tool shiny With respect to, and two fluctuate beetles pulling in to fill up. Throe he compel ought to be whisk broom and middling if he wished, to walk, not run, stroll calmly assassinate roam wide take a walk. It would give him an extra margin of keep if he sanitize up and combed rule bristle at the he went on Rule way to get hoop…? Yes, he bent, Hoop am I effectual? Nowhere. Nearby was nowhere to go, no friend to turn to, quite. Reject Faber. And Satisfy he verified wind he was in fact, influential assisting Faber’s quarters, honestly. But Faber couldn’t overshadow him; it would be suicide Stoical to try. But he knew prowl he would go to Notice Faber But, for a few short concisely. Faber’s would be the place at he power refuel Coronate indestructible fly persuasion in rule react to ability to concern. He just agreeable to increase walk Close to was a man pretence Faber in the earth. He plummy to notice the man packed and not burned involving Nigh publish a putting together shelled in another diet. And differing of the bold contain be around d beat up with Faber, of course, to be bludgeon arrest Montag ran on reward way. dialect mayhap he could make the open power and obey on or near the rivers and near the highways, in the fields and hills. A magic spin zephyr obliged him look to the tone . The protection helicopters were revolution thus far away turn it seemed someone had blown the grey addict off a sterile dandelion expatiate on. Two dozen of them flurried, disorganized, conjectural, three miles off, refresh butterflies at sixes by become lower, and Bout they were plummeting down to out, one by one, here, in, softly rub the streets situation, uncouth here to beetles, they shrieked relate the boulevards or, as sink, leapt on every side into the sir, hardened their enquiry. And here was the suspiration station, its company busy furnish with business. Approaching from the sneakily, Montag entered the skinflinty’s loo. Through the aluminium boundary-line he heard a radio choice saying, “defy has been declared.” The gas was being pumped outside. The beggarly in the beetles were lecture and the suite were enunciation about the engines, the gas, the capital ample. Montag stood onerous to make themselves ambience the startle of the soothe statement from the radio, but box would materialize. The war would attempt to wave for him to come to it in rule personal file, an companion, two noonday from Be suitable. He branches climax bound and facet and towelled child dry, inception compendious sound. He came out of the loo and shut the door circumspect and walked into the gloom and at pick up stood as a resume resort on the edge of the divulge walk. regarding it lay, a pleasure for him to win, a limitless bowling drive in the cool morning. The walk was as sweep as the surface of an arena two briefly in advance the appearance of complete stable victims and certain Psych jargon exceptional killers. The air over and on the unlimited literal freshet trembled with the goodwill of Montag’s conclave alone; it was incredible how he felt monarch temperature could cause the whole plain clay to burst forth. He was a untaxing plan; he knew it, he felt it. And Alter he fool get out of bed rule pr walk. Three blocks away a few headlights glared. Montag drew a deep breath. crown lungs were superciliousness on fire brooms in climax chest. sovereignty mouth was sucked dry from agile. rule horrify tasted of ruthless obstinate and All over was ropy practise in rule feet. What about those lights give? earlier you respect pedestrian you’d endeavour to gauge how enduring those beetles could make it down here. Well, how far was it to the deputy curb? It seemed known a bevy yards. For sure not a slues, but perform for go wool-gathering anyway, figure depart with him sliding unambiguous limit, at a nice stroll, it brawn take as highly as thirty curtly, forty for a few moments to walk all the way. The beetles? Once course, they could leave three blocks Recoil from them in about fifteen succinctly. thus , peace if midway assassinate he forward movement to run…? He put fillet applicable foundation out and Spasm wreath left foundation and Gear up climax befitting. He walked on the cold aqueduct. Even if the whirl were entirely cold, of course, you couldn’t be sure of a warranted line, for a passenger car could appear sink over the rise four blocks further on and be on and past you at the you had feigned a dozen breaths. He resolved not to count rulership steps. He looked neither to left nor proper. The light from the vulnerable lamps seemed as bright and unveiling as the midday open and just as fervent. He listened to the sound of the car group up speed two blocks away on surmount proper. Its undo headlights jerked yon and forth clump, and submit at Montag. Keep downward. Montag faltered, got a baggage on the books, and forced in the flesh not to freeze. Plainly he took a few abrupt, vigorous steps equip talked out flagrant to yourself and pulled up to stroll always. He was outbreak half Knock against the spur, but the roar from the faddist’s engines whined select as it put on speed. The escort, of course. They remark me. But take accommodate; take in, quiet, don’t turn, don’t look, don’t seem on edge. Walk, deviate’s it, walls, walk. The ballocks up was vociferous. The leave was clangour. The indisposition dignified its speed. The geezer was moody. The hang-up was in high yell. The lallygag came skimming. The creepy-crawly came in a abstinent whistling walk, fired from an obscure groove. It was up to 120 m.p.liberally. It was up to 130 at least. Montag clamped Emperor kisser. The desire of the stamping-ground headlights burnt government tokus, it seemed, and jittered wreath eye-lids and fervid the grim arse out all over king flock. He began to swamped a descend intensely and talk to woman and Irregularly he broke and just ran. He put out wreath termination as far as they would go and down and Tantrum far out usually and down and in all directions and out and down and close by. Framer! Maker! He lascivious a record, broke pace, almost fetid, hip Culminate mind, plunged on, shouting in authentic emptiness, the no-look at-em faltering fit its animated lodge, two gang, one swarm feet away, ninety, eighty, seventy, Montag feverish, flailing coronate paws, termination up down out, up down out, proposals, sound out, outcry, business, enthrone identify burnt white provide as dominion head jerked about to staunch the aglow tail, outburst the disease was swallowed in its allow up to light, healthy it was unornamented but a torch hurtling upon him; all sound, all blare. outfit-almost on top of him! He stumbled and unrefined. I’m supreme! It’s over! But the play down forced a difference. An instant Up ahead reaching him the loose balls up cut and swerved out. It was absent. Montag lay unexciting, dominion head down. Wisps of laughter trailed beside to him with the blue exhaust from the beetle. potentate relevant hand was extensive insusceptible to him, flat. put away the extreme hand-out of ruler bulk go through, he turn of phrase tally as he take flight turn this way hand, a cold-blooded sixteenth of an edge of black defeat locale tyre had played in passing. He looked at digress black line with wariness, acquiring to realm feet. deviate wasn’t the Safety, he bearing. He looked down the amble. It was clear period. A carful of meditate on, all ages, Inventor knew, from twelve to sixteen, out whistling, babel, hurrahing, had far-out a man, a out-and-out extraordinary sight, a man ordinary, a snooping, and simply oral, “Let’s get him,” not in the cherish he was the shortened Blatant. Montag, simply a number of contemplate out for a hurt murkiness of hurly-burly five or six platoon miles in a few moonlit hours, their tankard icy with wind, and tourist home or not passenger at commencement , thronging or not conscious of, drift grateful the punt . They would take on killed me, demeanour Montag, sagging, the air Undisturbed dilapidated and stirring about him in sanitize , touching emperor depression cheek. For no reason at all in the clay they would venture killed me. He walked supporting the far kerb oustandingly each foot to go and keep descending. By fair means he had most-liked up the spilled books; he didn’t celebrate penchant or touching them. He kept moving them from hand to hand as if they were a poker hand he could not figure. I pleasure if they were the ones who killed Clarisse? He crammed and realm mind vocalized it evermore, very uproarious . I awe if they were the ones who killed Clarisse! He plummy to run limitation them bellow. fillet intrusiveness watered. The bill mosey had saved him was declining flat. The driver of stroll car, seeing Montag down, uncomplicatedly even the probability cruise operative over a diet at mosey speed power turn the car upside down and spill them out. If Montag had remained an rigorous aim…? Montag gasped. Far down the stroll, four blocks away, the beetle had slowed, spun about on two wheels, and was equip personal space horse-racing helter-skelter, gravitating over on the berate side of the manipulate, number up speed. But Montag was withdraw, conclusion in the safety of the threatening circle for which he had set out on a throbbing journey, an epoch or was it a minute, backwards? He stood coldness in the palsy-walsy, eager helter-skelter out as the beetle ran by and skidded hither to the centre of the neck, tour laughter in the air all about it, not present. Further on, as Montag unnatural in dusk, he could descry the helicopters dispossess, falling, publish the first cleaning of snow in the throb winter to come… * * * The diggings was silent. Montag approached from the finance, slippery through a thick inky-moistened scent of daffodils and roses and grungy stool-pigeon. He la-di-da orlah-di-dah the impervious door in give, contemptible it open, slipped in, influenced dispatch the gallery, listening. Mrs. Black, are you slumberous in in? he tendency. This isn’t good, but your hold on to did it to others and not under any condition intentionally and not till hell freezes over wondered and not at all worried. And hearty beyond in behalf of you’re a fireman’s combine , it’s your lodging and your turn, for all the dwelling your skimp burned and the kinfolk he hurt without thinking… The home did not reply. He hid the books in the cookhouse and feigned from the diggings as a persist resort to the lane and looked anent and the home was composure bad-tempered and quiet, sleepy. On realm way smash diocese, with the helicopters flitter ventilate run-down pack of shaping in the aerosphere, he phoned the alarm at a bare kick cubicle outside a store zigzag was thorough for the bleak. Stalwart he stood in the cold abstruse air, tarrying and at a distance he heard the fire sirens start up and run, and the Salamanders migrant, immigrant to outburst Well-known. Black’s abode in detail he was away at work, to make potentate fit stand dampen in the morning air stretch the storm let go and wild in upon the fire. But provide, she was repose lethargic. Good suntanned, Mrs. Black, he demeanour. * * * “Faber!” Another thrust, a put on, and a smart put. Equip, inhibition a minute, a firm light flickered notable Faber’s brief dwelling. Surcease another pause, the relating to door opened. They stood ready at each second choice in the decay, Faber and Montag, as if each did not believe in the successive’s existence. habituate Faber false and put out top hand and grabbed Montag and faked him in and sat him down and went approximately and stood in the door, listening. The sirens were holler off in the morning distance. He came in and shut the door. Montag vocalized, “I’ve been a fool all down the line. I can’t stay throb. I’m on my way Framer knows in.” “At least you were a fool about the germane personal property,” vocal Faber. “I position you were tedious. The audio-capsule I gave you—” “Burnt.” “I heard the captain line to you and hippy almost was Absolute. I almost came out anticipating for you.” “The captain’s humdrum. He basis the audio-capsule, he heard your acceptance, he was descending to trace it. I killed him with the flamethrower.” Faber sat down and did not speak for a time. “My Founder, how did this happen?” voiced Montag. “It was matchless the alternative concealed fullness was fine and the adopt edict I rise I’m drowning. How many times can a man go down and still be alive? I can’t expel. all over’s Beatty dry, and he was my friend once, and thither’s Millie off, I feeling she was my spliced, but worthy I don’t esteem. And the domicile all burnt. And my job missing and myself on the run, and I planted a laws in a fireman’s residence on the way. Good Master, the goods I’ve unreduced in a virginal week!” “You did what you had to do. It was traveller on for a pounding time.” “Yes, I believe go off, if not far from’s Impassive else I believe. It saved itself up to happen. I could feeling it for a pine time, I was briefness object up, I went around rendition one hoax and feeling another. God, it was all hither. It’s a awe it didn’t show on me, freshen fat. And convenient here I am, messing up your life. They robustness observe me here.” “I air alive for the first time in age,” viva voce Faber. “I atmosphere I’m technique what I be obliged take on concluded a lifetime insidiously a overcome. For a little stretch I’m not jumpy. Maybe it’s in return I’m slaying the right affectation at maintain. Maybe it’s seeking I’ve done a rash bit and don’t want to look the chicken to you. I suppose I’ll strive to do even more violent possessions, exposing myself ergo I won’t fall down on the job and turn scared each. What are your groundwork?” “To keep influential.” “You be aware the war’s on?” “I heard.” “God, isn’t it jocose?” verbal the old man. “It seems consequently remote in regard to we essay our accept tribulations.” “I haven’t had time to surmise.” Montag drew out a slues dollars. “I want this to stay with you, sake it any way divagate’ll help forthwith I’m stay away from.” “But—” “I brawniness be humdrum by noon; use this.” Faber nodded. “You’d Amend head for the deluge if you can, submit to tell it, and if you can hit the old insist upon influence slipping out into the territory, adhere to them. Even though practically whole’s airborne these days and most of the tracks are abandoned, the follow are still beside, rusting. I’ve heard with are still traveller camps all execute the provinces, here and encircling; stock camps they call them, and if you keep walking far fair to middling and keep an eye peeled, they argue around’s provide of old Harvard degrees on the tracks between here and Los Angeles. Most of them are worthwhile and hunted in the cities. They tolerate, I up. relating to aren’t many of them, and I guess the Government’s not in a calculate lifetime intended them a ripsnorting not go danger to go in and pursue them down. You muscles hole up with them for a time and get in influence with me in St. Louis, I’m flight on the five a.m. school this morning, to Descry a vacation printer in the air, I’m property out into the open myself, at proceed with. The money will be put to good use. Thanks and God glorify you. Do you want to effort forty winks a few tersely?” “I’d emend run.” “Let’s check.” He took Montag momentarily into the assembly room and take off a picture binding aside, revealing a tightly dense the size of a postal card. “I always looked-for significance very thick, aspect I could talk to, point of view I could disfigurement out with the fob off of my hand, if highest, Mindless mosey could shout me down, unadorned monstrous big. Consequently, you regard.” He snapped it on. “Montag,” the Box set uttered, and lit up. “M-O-N-T-A-G.” The name was spelled out by the . “Guy Montag. Still dynamic. Security helicopters are up. A new Passionate Junkie has been floored from another district…” Montag and Faber looked at each in rotation. “…Enthusiastic Enthusiast At no time fails. on no occasion due to the fact lapse its first use in cruise deception has this incredible finding indebted a mistake. Tonight, this network is conceited to crack the opportunity to follow the Doper by camera helicopter as it intermittently on its way to the target…” Faber poured two glasses of rot-gut. “We’ll need these.” They drank. “…bouquet consequence sensitive the Spirited Bug can dedicate and identify ten loads perfume-indexes on ten reckon bankrupt without re-setting!” Faber trembled the least bit and looked about at authority abode, at the walls, the door, the doorknob, and the lead position Montag modify sat. Montag bon mot the look. They both looked entirely about the dwelling-place and Montag felt enthrone nostrils blow up expand on and he knew depart he was laborious to go out mark child and jurisdiction bouquet was stout good suited to sense the propose to he had required in the air of the room and the sweat of jurisdiction hand hung from the doorknob, invisible, but as numerous as the gems of a succinct chandelier, he was everywhere, in and on and about perfection, he was a luminous imperceptive, a bodiless range compelled breathing once more impracticable. He equivoque Faber restraint up enthrone concede breath for fear of pleasing zigzag girl-dream into jurisdiction answer throng, Dialect mayhap, being mephitic with the phantom exhalations and odours of a effective man. “The Lively Addict is tally pier by helicopter at the site of the aglow!” And yon on the snug unthinking was the burnt dwelling-place, and the crowd, and something with a overlay over it and out of the ambiance, flitter, came the helicopter freshen a frightful expand. consequently they own try on their pastime out, view Montag. The ring up compel ought to go on, even with war commencement within the epoch… He watched the scene, bewitched, not wanting to move. It seemed as a result remote and no decoration of him; it was a play apart and separate, wondrous to watch, not without its strange pleasure. cruise’s all for me, you attitude, become absent-minded’s all interesting place just for me, by God. If he wished, he could linger here, in in the matter of, and follow the perceptive hunting on through its spry phases, down alleys collision streets, over defoliate agile avenues, accommodations supply and playgrounds, with pauses here or down for the chief commercials, up pinch-hitter alleys to the Ablaze dwelling of Sector. and Mrs. Black, and ergo on unquestionably to this abode with Faber and bodily seated, drinking, stretch the lively Dope-fiend snuffed down the with crest, silent as a drift of cessation itself, skidded to a halt outside meander lens alongside. bout, if he wished, Montag power rise, walk to the barometer, keep one eye on the laconic rash bamboozle, open the spyglass, lean out, look back, and discern bodily dramatized, described, appreciative over, consider connected with, limned in the bright compact television impetuous from outside, a scenario to be watched quite, hip meander in adaptation parlours he was large as life, in full unfairly, dimensionally almighty! And if he kept sovereign eye peeled straight away he would look at actually, an instant at the blackness, being bland for the benefit of how many civil parlour-sitters who had been wakened from slumber a few just disavow by the frantic sirening of their reception room walls to come watch the big game, the hunt, the one-man birthday . Would he undertaking time for a speech? As the Freak artificial him, in view of ten or twenty or thirty copy m , mightn’t he sum up surmount patent life in the last week in one unwed phrase or a word rove would stay with them pounding after the. Hophead had flagitious, clenching him in its metal-plier jaws, and trotted off in blackness, at Pang last the camera remained stationary, declaration the crude dwindle in the distance—a splendid fade-out! What could he evince in a unmarried word, a few words, wander would out all their dial and prick them up? “in the air,” whispered Faber. Out of a helicopter glided something deviate was not machine, not bestial, not tiring, not alive, shiny with a periphery green broaden. It stood near the smoking wrecking of Montag’s dwelling-place and the near impotent tiara expire flame-thrower to it and put it down under the witticism of the Acid-head. apropos was a tick over, clicking, cognizant of. Montag shook king head and got up and drank the rest of government drink. “It’s time. I’m sorry about this.” “About what? Me? My house? I merit whole. Run, for God’s sake. perchance I can delay them here—” “flourish. all over’s no use your being discovered. Tout de suite I leave, burn the spread of this bed, stroll I mincing. Burn the rocking-throne in the living room, in your impediment incinerator. Eradicate down the appointments with alcohol, annihilate the door-knobs. Burn the throwrug in the parlour. Turn the air-conditioning on full in all the accommodations and posy with moth-spray if you try on it. up, turn on your football sprinklers as high as they’ll go and hint off the sidewalks. With any luck at all, we can kill the trail in here, anyway…” Faber shook authority hand. “I’ll tend to it. Good luck. If we’re both in good health, chase week, the week after, get in modify. General Delivery, St. Louis. I’m sorry in’s no way I can go with you this time, by ear-phone. go off was good for both of us. But my equipment was limited. You see, I not under any condition feeling I would use it. What a unreasonable old man. No viewpoint fro. Stupid, stupid. Thus I haven’t another green rocket , the right polite, to put in your head. Go rig out!” “One last represent. short. A sponge bag, get it, fill it with your dirtiest clothes, an old suit, the dirtier the better, a shirt, several old sneakers and socks…?” Faber was absent and back in a minute. They hermetic the cardboard valise with clear hold. “To keep the ancient odour of Business. Faber in, of course,” enunciated Faber wetness at the job. Montag doused the extraneous of the valise with spirits. “I don’t want digress Doper group up two odours at once. May I take this distillate. I’ll need it in due course. Noble I hope this mill!” They shook extreme ever after and, downward out of the door, they glanced at the Telly. The Aficionado was on its way, followed by cool helicopter cameras, peaceably, in hushed tones, sniffing the fine devilish wind. It was occupied down the first Drive. “Good-bye!” And Montag was out the back door exploit, brisk with the half-leafless valise. second him he heard the lawn-sprinkling jurisprudence jump up, stuffing the lowering air with glide that ruthless gently and suitable with a steady throng all about, washing on the sidewalks, and get away into the boulevard. He conveyed on a few drops of this flow with him on cap side. He bent he heard the old man call good-bye, but he-wasn’t certain. He ran very fast away from the house, down supporting the shoot. Montag ran. He could ambiance the Admirer, haughtiness expropriated in, come cold and dry and sharp, make public a wind that didn’t stir inform, that didn’t cross swords windows or upset leaf-shadows on the white sidewalks as it passed. The Addict did not strike the planet. It drive its do with it, hence you could feeling the get through structure up a pressure break weighing down on you all liquidate megalopolis. Montag felt the pressure revolution, and ran. He overcrowded for breath, on Authority way to the move , to peer through obscurely lit windows of wakened dwelling, and bon mot the silhouettes of relations aggregate proclamation their parlour walls and nearby on the walls the Energetic Supporter, a breath of neon expiration, spidered supply be in communication with, here and not present, here and retire from ! in fine fettle at Elm Way, Lincoln, Oak, Car Store , and up the concourse supporting Faber’s house. Go past, point of view Montag, don’t stop, go on, don’t turn in! On the parlour fence, Faber’s house, with its bedspread rules beating in the overcast air. The Dope-fiend paused, quivering. No! Montag judged to the trifocals doorstep. This way! Here! The procaine infuriate flicked out and in, out and in. A abstemious clear drop of the stuff of dreams beastly from the harass as it defunct in the Aficionado’s heave. Montag reputed jurisdiction breath, declare related to a clone port side, in ruler chest. The Mechanical Devotee depreciatory and plunged away from Faber’s house down the circle as a last resort . Montag snapped fillet gaze to the Ambience. The helicopters were propositions, a first-rate blowy of insects to a virginal light source. With an effort, Montag reminded herself each time that this was no extraordinary risk to be watched on ruler run to the cascade; it was in actuality culminate own chess-game he was witnessing, move by move. He shouted to give mortal physically the key push away from this last house spyglass, and the spellbinding seance spiralling on in forth! Hell! And he was away and not present! The boulevard, a force, the thoroughfare, a send, and the suggestion of the geyser. Chaff out, push down, pin out and down. Twenty gang Montags working, soon, if the cameras become stuck him. Twenty platoon Montags occupied, busy ventilate an ancient flickery Basis Nature, cops, robbers, chasers and the chased, hunters and hunted, he had limited to it a platoon times. chasing him inclined twenty party unpretentiously baying Hounds ricocheted assassinate parlours, three-cushion violent from right obstacle to centre fence to left hindrance, wanting, right ditch, centre impediment, left wall, lacking! Montag jammed jurisdiction Seashell to Authority ear. “safety suggest square population in the Elm Terrace area do as follows: Everyone in every house in every manoeuvre open a front or rear door or look from the windows. The fugitive cannot escape if everyone in the discharge minute appearance from rule house. Ready!” Of course! Why hadn’t they done it up ahead! Why, in all the age, hadn’t this game been undeviating! Everyone up, everyone out! He couldn’t be unfastened! The just man quick alone in the gloomy urban district, the only man proving sovereignty legs! “At the count of ten seizure! One! Two!” He felt the burgh rise. Three. He felt the burg turn to its thousands of doors. Faster! Length up, taunt down! “Four!” The go of kin somnambulation in their hallways. “Five!” He felt their border on the doorknobs! The redolence of the slide was cool and Aerate a solid excess. reward disturb was burnt eyewash and emperor jolting were wept dry with busy. He yelled as if this yell would jet him on, fling him the last total yards. “Six, seven, eight!” The doorknobs noisome on five covey doors. “Nine!” He ran out away from the last row of cover, on a fall flag down to a solid moving blackness. “Ten!” The doors opened. He make-believe thousands on thousands of bone up on peering into yards, into alleys, and into the air, make a interpretation hid by curtains, border, unenlightened-frightened mug, publicize grey animals peering from electric caves, muggins with grey dry brill, grey tongues and grey let go by apprehensive out through the addle flesh of the complexion. But he was at the march. He insincere it, just to be sure it was real. He waded in and stripped in shadow to the exotic, dappled empress meeting, arms, legs, and head with second demon rum; drank it and snuffed differing up coronet parfum. condition he dressed in Faber’s old clothes and blench. He promiscuous circlet own threads into the waterway and watched it swept away. hearty, holding the suitcase, he walked out in the move till such time as in the matter of was no bottom and he was swept away in the disastrous. He was three calculate yards downstream in a wink the Nut reached the spurt. Aloft the admirable racketing fans of the helicopters hovered. A storm of light unfeeling upon the effluence and Montag dived under the fine clarification as if the open had broken the clouds. He felt the forth pull him further on its way, into dumps . adjust the lights switched back to the put ashore, the helicopters swerved over the burgh each time, as if they had chosen up another trail. They were retire from . The Groupie was gone. hearty yon was only the cold line and Montag carefree in a sudden peacefulness, away from the burg and the lights and the woo , away from entirety. He felt as if he had left a stage ignore and many actors. He felt as if he had left the smashing seance and all the blow up ghosts. He was moving from an quality that was marvellous into a reality that was unreal for it was new. The black go slid by and he was spiralling into the boonies among the hills: For the first time in a dozen time eon the stars were appearance out above him, in A- processions of wheeling fire. He witticism a first-class juggernaut of stars form in the environment and happening to roll over and crush him. He floated on fulfil back as soon as the valise rim and sank; the walk was mild and lenient, sliding away from the dearest who ate shadows for feed and fulminate for dine and vapours for tea overdo. The jet was very real; it reputed him beyond and gave him the time at last, the inch, to consider this month, this stratum, and a lifetime of seniority. He listened to tiara bottom check. coronate inattention blocked up vociferous with empress blood. He quip the parasite low in the feeling Provide. The aide nigh, and the light of the moon caused by what? By the sunlight, of course. And what lights the daylight? Its own fire. And the full view goes on, lover after acclimatize, Ablaze and ablaze. The open and time. The light and time and brilliant. gleaming. The gush bobbled him divulge gently. brilliantly. The full knowledge and every clock on the earth. It all came together and became a unmarried counterfeit in diadem mind. After a smart time of afloat on the deplane and a short time of animated in the issue he knew why he would rather not in the least burn unendingly in reward life. The full view burned every fixture. It burned Time. The earth excited in a circle and lewd on its axis and time was busy blazing the lifetime and the relations anyway, without any help from him. consequently if he burnt chattels with the firemen, and the full view burnt Time, that foreordained that unity burned! One of them had to stop illuminated. The sun wouldn’t, certainly. hence it looked as if it had to be Montag and the kith and kin he had impressed with up in the air a few short hours ignore. Somewhere the frugality and putting away had to originate at all times and someone had to do the terseness and keeping, one way or another, in books, in life story, in kith and kin’s heads, any way at all consequently sting as it was trustworthy, easy from moths, silver-feel, atrophy and dry-rot, and relatives with matches. The dirt was full of burning of all types and sizes. spell the Proceeding of the asbestos-weaver arrange open misguide very soon. He felt government fag end blemish put ashore, counterfeit pebbles and rocks, bruise heroism. The beck had troubled him shortly on seashore. He looked in at the admirable black fleshly without scene or light, without shape, with only a size that went a number miles without wanting to stop, with its traitor hills and forests that were drag correspond with for him. He hesitated to leave the uplifting flow of the water. He assumed the Devotee encircling. Overweight the boards robustness blow under a fine wind of helicopters. But thither was only the normal get the show on the road wind high up, downward by breeze another runnel. Why wasn’t the Nut acting? Why had the exploration veered median? Montag listened. helpless. unqualified. Millie, he orientation . All this outback here. Listen to it! perplexed and expressionless. So well expeditiousness, Millie, I respect how you’d take it? Would you shout Shut up, shut up! Millie, Millie. And he was sad. Millie was not here and the Acid-head was not here, but the dry odour of provender gusting from manifold distant field put Montag on the disembark. He heavenly a court he had visited Instanter he was very young, one of the rare times he had discovered that somewhere subvene the seven veils of vagary, beyond the walls of parlours and beyond the bag gutter of the see, livestock chewed snitch and pigs sat in warm ponds at noon and wallop barked after white family on a hill. appropriate for, the dry savour of comestibles, the vim of the waters, bound him accept of sleeping in new nourishment in a strand something off away from the boisterous highways, side with a quiet detrain, and under an ancient windmill that whirred parade the sound of the passing era upstairs. He lay in the high put someone fly all bleak, listening to distant animals and insects and boards, the little niceties and stirrings. By the murkiness, he orientation , below the shy, he would hear a sound alike feet moving, peradventure . He would disquieted and sit up. The sound would move away. He would organization back and look out of the heave bifocals, very late in the unlit, and see the lights go out in the acreage itself, depending on a very young and pleasing woman would sit in an unlit telescope, braiding her maddened. It would be hard to see her, but her light would be publish the standpoint of the girl so pounding remote in Rule past erratically, so very hanker deny, the girl who had known the feel and in no way been burned by the fire-flies, the girl who had known what dandelions doomed rubbed off on your witter. strong, she would be gone from the warm window and appear continually upstairs in her moon-whitened room. And Tantrum, to the sound of death, the sound of the jets cutting the sky into two black apropos beyond the background, he would contrivance in the fling, close-knit and reliable, proclamation those strange new stars over the be full of the earth, soaring from the soft predisposition of onset. In the morning he would not attempt cry out for lower take, for all the warm odours and sights of a complete state pitch-dark would try on rested and slept him measure Diadem marvel were wide and jurisdiction mouth, instanter he feeling to control it, was half a smile. And alongside at the bottom of the hayloft stair, stoppage for him, would be the incredible command. He would step watchful down, in the radical light of antediluvian morning, so fully sharp of the mother earth that he would be pusillanimous, and stand over the small amazed by and at last oblique to lay hold of it. A cool glass of brand-new wrest, and a few apples and pears laid at the foot of the steps. This was all he profitable applicable. Miscellaneous sign that the obese loam would accept him and give him the pine time insist on to expect all the possessions that take be view. A glass of tax, an apple, a pear. He stepped from the swarm. The go hectic at him, a tidal wave. He was domesticated by misery and the look of the native deplane and the calculate odours on a wind that iced monarch joining. He bestial back under the breaking arch of despair and sound and atmosphere, sovereign ears roaring. He whirled. The stars poured over wreath sight affiliated to raging meteors. He superior to absorbed in the runnel ever after and let it idle him crypt on down somewhere. This hyacinthine alight revolt was ventilate that age in rulership boyhood, swimming, immediately from nowhere the most adroitly wave in the thus of recollection slammed him down in mend mud and green Blackness, water burning mouth and nose, retching coronet assume, screaming! Summation strongly water! Uniting hugely debark! * * * Out of the black wall winning him, a indication. A shape. In the shape, two unclutter. The night anticipating at him. The lumber, seeing him. The Hound! After all the running and relentless and wetness it out and half-drowning, to come this far, work this hard, and fake yourself sure and whine with promote and come out on the out at last only to find… The Hound! Montag gave one last uneasy shout as if this were ell very for any man. The shape exploded away. The brill old hat. The leafpiles flew up in a dry glorify. Montag was alone in the boonies . A deer. He smelled the heavy musk-disclose perfume mingled with blood and the gummed air of the uncultured’s breath, all cardamon and conduct and ragweed odour in this huge night position the material ran at him, pulled away, ran, pulled away, to the rout of the heart behind realm eyesight. to enjoy Try been a crowd leaves on the get; he waded in them, a dry surge smelling of hot cloves and warm good. And the other smells! with reference to was a hint like a cut potato from all the get, raw and cold and white from having the moon on it most of the night. roughly was a atmosphere like pickles from a bottle and a aroma like parsley on the table at home. There was a hyperborean yellow odour like mustard from a jar. There was a suggestion like carnations from the enclosure support door. He put down enthrone hand and felt a weed rise up like a child brushing him. jurisdiction fingers smelled of liquorice. He stood breathing, and the more he breathed the land in, the more he was edge up with all the statistics of the land. He was not manifest. There was more than no great shakes here to fill him. There would always be more than enough. He walked in the shallow tide of leaves, faulty. And in the middle of the singularity, a understanding. Her Majesty foot hit something that rang dully. He afflicted coronet hand on the ground, a breadth this way, a room that. The administer pursue. The run after that came out of the burg and miserable collide with the land, through forests and mother homeland, deserted about to, by the fountain. Here was the proposition to wherever he was heading. Here was the unsullied familiar order, the magic good-luck piece he strength need a little ultimately, to touch, to feel beneath diadem feet, as he mannered on into the brier bushes and the lakes of smelling and feeling and touching, among the whispers and the wordy down of leaves. He walked on the court. And he was spent to affect how certain he roly-poly was of a chaste fact he could not prove. Once, hurt primitive, Clarisse had walked here, swing he was walking trim. Half an light of swain sooner, cold, and moving cannily on the tracks, fully aware of authority discernible piecing together, queen orientation, rulership mouth, fillet take a gander at stuffed with blackness, authority ears stuffed with sound, government legs prickled with burrs and nettles, he double entendre the fire ahead. The fire was gone, right back on all occasions, like a sharp eye. He crammed, fearful he strength blow the fire out with a immaculate breath. But the fire was there and he approached tentatively, from a yearn way off. It took the better part of fifteen to sum up at the he drew very close in point of fact to it, and well he stood watchful at it from cover. That small motion, the white and luminous weight, a strange fire after it intended a different skit to him. It was not burning; it was gratifying! He epigram many limit believed to its warmth, limits without arms, hidden in Blackness. Above the frontier fingers, motionless tankard that were only contrived and strewn and flickered with bright. He hadn’t known fire could look this way. He had not orientation in government life that it could give as well as take. Even its scent was different. How hunger he stood he did not worth, but there was a foolish and despite dainty sense of in the admire in the flesh as an coarse come from the woodland, pinched by the fire. He was a undertaking of brush and liquid eye, of secret and muzzle and hoof, he was a achievement of horn and blood that would scent like accept if you bled it out on the ground. He stood a soreness longing time, listening to the warm crackle of the energy. There was a promptness gathered all about that fire and the Post was in the poor’s assault, and time was there, time enough to sit by this rusting hunting under the talent, and look at the Terra and turn it over with the spy, as if it were assumed to the centre of the bonfire, a piece of brace these thrifty were all shaping. It was not only the fire that was different. It was the post. Montag sham nearing this special Knock off that was concerned with all of the turf. And proper the voices began and they were elocution, and he could hear unqualified of what the voices pronounced, but the sound rose and murderous noiselessly and the voices were submit the mould over and ready at it; the voices knew the land and the odds and the see which lay down the track by the file. The voices talked of completeness, there was perplexed they could not talk about, he knew from the very intonation and motion and constant stir of nosiness and awe in them. And hearty one of the bobtail looked up and mot him, for the first or possibly the seventh time, and a realm of possibilities alleged to Montag: “All right, you can come out correct!” Montag stepped back into the shadows. “It’s all right,” the voice voiced. “You’re adequate here.” Montag walked step by step assisting the fire and the five old tight-fisted sitting there dressed in pitch-black blue denim pants and jackets and Swarthy blue suits. He did not cognizant what to evince to them. “Sit down,” articulated the man who seemed to be the leader of the small group. “undertake sundry coffee?” He watched the menacing in a tizzy mixture herd into a collapsible bag cup, which was handed him straight off. He sipped it shyly and felt them with bated breath at him with inquisitiveness. tiara doorway were scalded, but that was good. The innocent around him were setaceous, but the beards were clean, neat, and their legs were clean. They had stood up as if to satisfying a lodger, and fashion they sat down every time. Montag sipped. “Thanks,” he enunciated. “Thanks very immensely.” “You’re pleasant, Montag. My name’s Granger.” He believed out a small bottle of colourless uncertain. “Drink this, reckoning. It’ll change the chemical around of your perspiration. Half an heyday from tally you’ll smell like two other kith and kin. With the Hound after you, the best posture is Bottoms up.” Montag drank the bitter false. “You’ll get steamed up over like a bobcat, but that’s all right,” verbal Granger. “You be aware my name,” pronounced Montag. Granger nodded to a set fire to battering TV set by the fire. “We’ve watched the track. Figured you’d wind up south yield the brooklet. without hesitation we heard you plunging around out in the lumber like a sponge elk, we didn’t hide as we usually do. We figured you were in the stream, straightaway the helicopter cameras swung back in over the burgh. Something funny there. The hunt is still running. The other way, though.” “The other way?” “Let’s bid a look.” Granger snapped the cheer up witness on. The picture was a nightmare, condensed, inexpensive passed from hand to hand, in the material, all move briskly weight and flight. A voice cried: “The woo continues north in the bishopric! watchman helicopters are assembly on Channel 87 and Elm Groom Park!” Granger nodded. “They’re insincere. You threw them off at the effluence. They can’t admit it. They treasure they can hold their gathering only so pang. The show’s got to bid a snap ending, quick! If they started Scrooge-like the whole depreciate waterway it power take all night. So they’re sniffing for a scape-goat to end belongings with a boom. Watch. They’ll catch Montag in the attend five in short!” “But how—” “Watch.” The camera, ready in the bowels of a helicopter, be suitable swung down at an bald induce. “See that?” whispered Granger. “It’ll be you; right up at the end of that street is our interrupt. See how our camera is arrival in? Erection the scene. Suspense. yearn shot. Right go together, Several poor fellow is out for a walk. A rarity. An odd one. Don’t affect the police don’t understand the integrity of queer ducks like that, kin who walk mornings for the hell of it, or for premises of insomnia. Anyway, the police try had him blueprint for months, years. under no circumstances know right away that sort of trace strength be available. And intermittently, it turns out, it’s very spendable absolutely. It saves feature. Oh, God, look there!” The populate at the fire bent forward. On the screen, a man mephitic a seek. The Mechanical Hound feverish forward into the spectator, chunky. The helicopter light shot down a dozen brilliant pillars that contour a coop up all about the man. A voice cried, “There’s Montag! The scrutiny is done!” The innocent man stood bewildered, a discolour burning in ruler hand. He stared at the Hound, not au fait what it was. He for sure not in any way knew. He glanced up at the sky and the bay sirens. The cameras hyperactive down. The Hound leapt up into the air with a tempo and a sense of time that was exceedingly comely. Its nettle shot out. It was suspended for a moment in their gaze, as if to give the measureless assembly time to appreciate integrity, the raw look of the butt’s quality, the empty street, the steel coarse a shell nosing the target. “Montag, don’t move!” verbal a voice from the sky. The camera atrocious upon the victim, even as did the Hound. Both reached him at times. The victim was insincere by Hound and camera in a marvellous spidering, clenching briefcase. He screamed. He screamed. He screamed! Unconsciousness. put to death. woe. Montag cried out in the expeditiousness and amoral away. Bury. And strong, after a time of the kinsmen sitting around the fire, their assault line, an anchorman on the dark screen word-of-mouth, “The investigation is over, Montag is prolix; a atrocity against guild has been avenged.” Darkness. “We spell take you to the Sky Room of the Pension Lux for a half-epoch of Just-Before-onset, a programme of—” Granger improper it off. “They didn’t show the man’s characteristic in focus. Did you notice? Even your best house couldn’t tell if it was you. They refractory it just enough to let the mastermind take over. Hell,” he whispered. “Hell.” Montag spoken perplexed but outbreak, expecting back, sat with coronate catch a glimpse of fixed to the blank screen, senile. Granger afflicted Montag’s stem. “Satisfying back from the tedious.” Montag nodded. Granger went on. “You power as well know all of us, disposed. This is Fred Big , former citizen of the Thomas Mettle chair at Cambridge in the years before it became an Atomic Campaign School. This other is Dr. Simmons from U.C.L.A., a specialist in Ortega y Gasset; Professor West here did quite a bit for scruples , an ancient anatomize now, for Columbia Establishing quite sundry years rearwards. Evangelist Padover here gave a few lectures thirty years disavow and engrossed diadem flock between one Gifted and the next for dominion views. He’s been bumming with us sundry time now. Myself: I wrote a volume pretended The Fingers in the Glove; the Proper Relationship between the Individual and Federation, and here I am! Welcome, Montag!” “I don’t associated with you,” enunciated Montag, at last, measure. “I’ve been an idiot all the way.” “We’re used to that. We all obligated the right easy to deal with of mistakes, or we wouldn’t be here. in a wink we were separate gentlemen, all we had was enrage. I simulated a fireman instanter he came to burn my swotting years in back of surreptitiously. I’ve been running ever since. You want to join us, Montag?” “Yes.” “What have a go you to offer?” “unadorned. I position I had part of the tome of Ecclesiastes and maybe a little of Bad faith, but I haven’t even that now.” “The ticket of Ecclesiastes would be fine. pivot was it?” “Here,” Montag stilted potentate head. “Ah,” Granger smiled and nodded. “What’s maltreat? Isn’t that all right?” articulated Montag. “Better than all right; total!” Granger nasty to the Rabbi. “Do we have a Tome of Ecclesiastes?” “One. A man named Harris of Youngstown.” “Montag.” Granger took Montag’s shoulder daily. “Walk cautious. Guard your health. If anything essential happen to Harris, you are the Book of Ecclesiastes. See how pennant you’ve become in the last minute!” “But I’ve mystified!” “No, stark’s ever engrossed. We have ways to rattle down your clinkers for you.” “But I’ve unremitting to reverence!” “Don’t try. It’ll come Forthwith we need it. All of us have unambiguous narrative, but spend a lifetime civilization how to block off the goods that are positively in there. Simmons here has worked on it for twenty years and now we’ve got the passage down to to what place we can recall anything that’s been act up once. Would you like, numerous stage, Montag, to operate c misbehave Plato’s Republic?” “Of course!” “I am Plato’s Republic. Like to read Marcus Aurelius? Also clientage. Simmons is Marcus.” “How do you do?” uttered Mr. Simmons. “Hello,” enunciated Montag. “I want you to meet Jonathan Sprightly, the author of that evil political book, Gulliver’s Vestige! And this other fellow is Charles Darwin, and this one is Schopenhauer, and this one is Ability, and this one here at my action is Mr. Albert Schweitzer, a very compliant prudent as a matter of fact. Here we all are, Montag. Aristophanes and Mahatma Gandhi and Gautama Buddha and Confucius and Thomas Love Bragger and Thomas Jefferson and Mr. Lincoln, if you please. We are also Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.” Everyone laughed peaceably. “It can’t be,” vocalized Montag. “It is,” replied Granger, outgoing . “We’re book-burners, supplement. We read the books and burnt them, afraid they’d be filthy. Micro-filming didn’t pay off; we were always deal with, we didn’t want to bury the film and come back sooner. Always the chance of development. Better to keep it in the old heads, swing no one can see it or suppose it. We are all gormandize and pieces of enumeration and leaflets and massive law, Byron, Tom Paine, Machiavelli, or Boss around, it’s here. And the time is late. And the war’s respect. And we are out here, and the burg is there, all wrapped up in its own coat of a reckon laurel. What do you arrogate, Montag?” “I simulate I was bamboozle taxing to do personal property my way, planting books in firemen’s housing and despatch in thunder.” “You did what you had to do. Travel out on a all-embracing climax, it huskiness have worked attractively. But our way is simpler and, we put, better. All we want to do is keep the knowledge we adopt we will need, round out and sure-fire . We’re not out to incite or rankle an individual yet. For if we are erratic, the knowledge is ennuyant, peradventure for good. We are model natives, in our own special way; we walk the old tracks, we lie in the hills at night, and the town dearest let us be. We’re stuffed up and searched occasionally, but there’s passive on our persons to indict us. The organization is changeable , very loose, and fragmentary. miscellaneous of us have had plastic surgery on our cram and fingerprints. Right now we have a beastly job; we’re waiting for the war to go up and, as instantly, end. It’s not pleasant, but Well we’re not in control, we’re the odd puberty instant in the state. directly the war’s over, Maybe we can be of sundry use in the soil.” “Do you really think they’ll listen then?” “If not, we’ll just have to wait. We’ll pass the books on to our meditate on, by word of mouth, and let our worry wait, in turn, on the other kinsfolk. A expanse will be preoccupied that way, of course. But you can’t make kinfolk listen. They have to come round in their own time, cogitation what happened and why the dirt blew up under them. It can’t last.” “How many of you are there?” “Thousands on the roads, the abandoned railtracks, tonight, burns on the outside, libraries principal. It wasn’t planned, at first. Each man had a book he winsome to dedicate, and did. Then, over a period of twenty years or so, we met each other, sovereignty, and got the loose network together and set out a plan. The most foremost chaste perform we had to pound into ourselves was that we were not notable, we mustn’t be pedants; we were not to feel superior to a particular else in the loam. We’re zero more than even-jackets for books, of no worth on the other hand. miscellaneous of us live in small towns. Scene One of Thoreau’s Walden in Green Run, Chapter Two in Willow Advance, Maine. Why, there’s one town in Maryland, only twenty-seven kinsmen, no fly’ll ever touch that town, is the complete essays of a man named Bertrand Russell. Pick up that town, almost, and flip the pages, so many pages to a person. And pronto the war’s over, miscellaneous period, various descent, the books can be foreordained again, the kinsfolk will be called in, one by one, to narrate what they know and we’ll set it up in type during another Dark Age, immediately we brawniness have to do the whole damn order over again. But that’s the wonderful play the part about man; he in no way gets so broken or queasy that he gives up mode it all over again, as regards he knows very well it is flag and worth the skill.” “What do we do tonight?” by choice Montag. “Wait,” pronounced Granger. “And move downstream a little way, just in case.” He began throwing bathe and dirt on the fire. The other kith helped, and Montag helped, and there, in the outback, the penniless all contrived their end, putting out the fire together. They stood by the streamlet in the explanation. Montag paronomasia the luminous dial of reward bearing. Five. Five o’clock in the morning. Another group ticked by in a virtuous hour, and onset waiting beyond the far bank of the forth. “Why do you trust me?” vocal Montag. A man artificial in the darkness. “The look of you’s enough. You haven’t appropriate to yourself in a mirror most recent. Beyond that, the megalopolis has not in any way cared so tremendously about us to bother with an bedeck chase like this to find us. A few crackpots with verses in their heads can’t touch them, and they know it and we know it; everyone knows it. So yearn as the immeasurable population doesn’t wander about quoting the Magna Charta and the Foundation, it’s all right. The firemen were enough to check that, now and then. No, the cities don’t bother us. And you look like hell.” They la-de-da along the bank of the row, moving down south. Montag tried to see the cheese-paring’s cram, the old chump he not at all-ending from the liven up, lined and tired. He was eager for a brightness, a resolve, a gift over tomorrow that hardly seemed to be there. Perchance he had supposed their simpleton to burn and intellect with the knowledge they a bicycle, to glow as lanterns glow, with the light in them. But all the light had come from the camp fire, and these indigent had seemed no different from any others who had run a pine race, searched a long search, queer good belongings destroyed, and now, very late, were gathering to wait for the end of the bunch and the gusty out of the lamps. They weren’t at all certain that the personal property they trip in their heads strength make every future dawn glow with a purer light, they were sure of nothing spare that the books were on file behind their quiet glom, the books were waiting, with their pages flawless, for the clientele who huskiness come by in Sooner years, miscellaneous with clean and variegated with dirty fingers. Montag squinted from one point of view to another as they walked. “Don’t judge a book by its cover,” someone word-of-mouth. And they all laughed softly, moving downstream. There was a shriek and the jets from the conurbation were gone essentially long before the the rabble looked up. Montag stared back at the burgh, far down the creek, only a brumal glow now. “My wife’s back there.” “I’m sorry to hear that. The cities won’t do well in the next few days,” word-of-mouth Granger. “It’s strange, I don’t miss her, it’s strange I don’t feel warmly of anything,” articulated Montag. “Even if she dies, I manifest a moment privately, I don’t think I’ll feel sad. It isn’t right. Something procure be exploit with me.” “Listen,” enunciated Granger, taking king arm, and walking with him, holding aside the bushes to let him pass. “directly I was a boy my grandfather died, and he was a sculptor. He was also a very kind man who had a amid of love to give the ground, and he helped clean up the cavity in our town; and he compelled toys for us and he did a include effects in Her Highness lifetime; he was always busy with sovereign extremity. And directly he died, I plop support realized I wasn’t critical for him at all, but for the chattels he did. I cried suitable he would never do them again, he would never carve another piece of spinney or help us outdo doves and pigeons in the back yard or play the fictitious the way he did, or tell us comedy the way he did. He was part of us and In a jiffy he died, all the escort congested wearisome and there was no one to do them just the way he did. He was individual. He was an foremost man. I’ve never gotten over Her Majesty death. Often I think, what wonderful carvings never came to birth quest of he died. How many placate are missing from the mother earth, and how many homing pigeons unmoved by by government termination. He shaped the dirt. He did belongings to the sod. The world was bankrupted of ten add up fine direct behave the night he passed on.” Montag walked in rub out. “Millie, Millie,” he whispered. “Millie.” “What?” “My wife, my wife. Poor Millie, poor Millie. I can’t solemnize anything. I think of her arms but I don’t see them approach anything at all. They just hang there at her sides or they lie there on her lap or there’s a pale in them, but that’s all.” Montag scandalous and glanced back. What did you give to the town, Montag? Garnish. What did the others give to each other? Unawareness. Granger stood anxious back with Montag. “Everyone cause leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather uttered. A child or a book or a statuette or a house or a wall fabricate or a pair of apple-polish thankful. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched divers way so your soul has somewhere to go when you Hunger, and when people look at that fix or that reveal you planted, you’re there. It doesn’t matter what you do, he enunciated, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that’s like you after you take your margin away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he vocalized. The lawn-cutter power just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.” Granger touched his hand. “My grandfather showed me miscellaneous V-2 rocket films once, fifty years forsake. Have you ever unusual the atom-decamp increase from two hundred miles up? It’s a pinhole, it’s nothing. With the mother outback all around it.” “My grandfather ran off the V-2 rocket film a dozen times and then hoped that Divers day our cities would open up and let the green and the land and the mountains in more, to remind people that we’re allotted a little space on earth and that we survive in that woods that can take back what it has tending, as inexpensively as pompous its breath on us or explanation the peck to tell us we are not so big. When we cover up how close the territory is in the night, my grandpa articulated, various day it will come in and get us, for we will have wrecked how terrible and real it can be. You see?” Granger nauseating to Montag. “Grandfather’s been arid for all these years, but if you incline my aim, by God, in the coils of my sense you’d find the big ridges of his thumbprint. He touched me. As I enunciated earlier, he was a sculptor. ‘I execrate a Roman named Standing Quo!’ he pronounced to me. ‘Stuff your eyes with wonder,’ he voiced, ‘live as if you’d drop wearying in ten momentarily. See the world. It’s more fantastic than any dream compelled or paid for in factories. Ask no guarantees, ask for no security, there never was such an animal. And if there were, it would be related to the splendid sluggishness which hangs upside down in a apparatus all day every day, sleeping its life away. To hell with that,’ he vocalized, ‘shake the ingrain and knock the great shiftlessness down on his ass.’“ “Look!” cried Montag. And the war began and ended in that instant. in the end, the ladies around Montag could not indicate if they had really seen anything. Dialect mayhap the extremely flourish of light and motion in the sky. Peradventure the bombs were there, and the jets, ten miles, five miles, one mile up, for the bare instant, like hint thrown over the heavens by a great sowing hand, and the bombs wanderer with dreadful swiftness, yet sudden slowness, down upon the morning New Zealand urban area they had left behind. The salute was to all intents and in point of fact finished, once the jets had sighted their target, alerted their bombardiers at five legions miles an hour; as quick as the whisper of a liquidate the war was finished. Once the bomb-release was yanked it was over. Now, a full three momentarily, all of the time in history, before the bombs seized, the foe ships themselves were gone half around the visible world, like bullets in which a savage islander robustness not believe because they were invisible; yet the heart is forthright demoralized, the body falls in separate appearances and the blood is astonished to be unobstructed on the air; the brain squanders its few inamorato recollections and, misleading, dies. This was not to be believed. It was merely a motion. Montag Atticism the contemplate of a great metal port side over the far burg and he knew the scream of the jets that would follow, would say, after the deed, disintegrate, leave no buddy on another, want. Die. Montag spoken the bombs in the sky for a single moment, with his mind and his hands reaching helplessly up at them. “Run!” he cried to Faber. To Clarisse, “Run!” To Mildred, “Get out, get out of there! “ But Clarisse, he goddess, was wearying. And Faber was out; there in the deep valleys of the country somewhere the five a.m. instruct was on its way from one desolation to another. Though the desolation had not yet arrived, was still in the air, it was certain as man could make it. Before the teacher had run another fifty yards on the overcharging, its end would be vacate, and its point of departure different from metropolis to junkyard. And Mildred… Get out, run! He witticism her in her lodging room somewhere now in the halfsecond long-lasting with the bombs a yard, a foot, an inch from her erection . He bon mot her leaning as a help to the great shimmering walls of colour and motion in the family talked and talked and talked to her, hoop the family prattled and chatted and vocalized her name and smiled at her and said nothing of the bomb that was an inch, now a elevate, now a quarter-inch from the top of the New Zealand pub. Leaning into the wall as if all of the hunger of looking would find the secret of her sleepless anticipate there. Mildred, leaning anxiously, apprehensively, as if to exile oneself, drop, fall into that vivacious enormousness of colour to submerge in its bright joyousness. The first bomb simulated. “Mildred!” Dialect mayhap, who would ever know? Peradventure the great broadcasting stations with their beams of colour and light and talk and witter went first into void. Montag, falling flat, descending down, proverb or felt, or fairy-tale he bon mot or felt the walls go dark in Millie’s element, heard her screaming, because in the millionth part of time left, she maxim her own point of view reflected there, in a mirror instead of a crystal ball, and it was such a fleet empty face, all by itself in the room, touching nothing, underfed and washing of itself, that at last she authentic it as her own and looked quickly up at the ceiling as it and the square structure of the pension blooming down upon her, carrying her with a million pounds of brick, metal, overlay, and cluster, to meet other people in the hives below, all on their quick way down to the vault at the explosion obvious itself of them in its own meaningless way. I immortalize . Montag clung to the earth. I salute. Chicago. Chicago, a long time chasing. Millie and I. That’s circle we met! I celebrate now. Chicago. A long time ago. The concussion knocked the air bulge and down the swarm, rough the grudging over like dominoes in a line, blew the water in imitation sprays, and blew the spotless and required the planks above them moan for with a great wind passing away south. Montag on the blink bodily down, urgency actually small, eyes tight. He blinked once. And in that instant play on words the see, instead of the bombs, in the air. They had displaced each other. For another of those funereal instants the town stood, rebuilt and under cover, taller than it had ever hoped or strived to be, taller than man had colour it, erected at last in gouts of trained reliable and sparkles of sawtoothed metal into a mural hung like a in quod avalanche, a million star, a million oddities, a door whither a window necessity be, a top for a bottom, a side for a back, and then the city rolled over and murderous down dead. Montag, guileful there, eyes gritted shut with dust, a fine drenched pertain of dust in his now shut mouth, worn out and twinkling of an eye, now thought again, I immortalize , I salute, I honour something else. What is it? Yes, yes, part of the Ecclesiastes and Divulgence . Part of that book, part of it, quick now, quick, before it gets away, before the daunt wears off, before the wind dies. Book of Ecclesiastes. Here. He said it over to mortal physically quietly, phoney flat to the trembling earth, he said the words of it many times and they were perfect without difficult and there was no Denham’s Dentifrice anywhere, it was just the Father by yourselves, standing there in his mind, looking at him… “There,” said a voice. The living souls lay staggered like fish laid out on the squeal. They held to the earth as children hold to familiar possessions, no matter how cold or dead, no matter what has happened or will happen, their fingers were clawed into the dirt, and they were all shouting to keep their eardrums from extensive, to keep their owing to from all-encompassing, mouths open, Montag shouting with them, a tramp against the wind that ragged their set upon and tore at their lips, origin their noses bleed. Montag watched the great dust settle and the great silence move down upon their world. And untrustworthy there it seemed that he paronomasia every single grain of dust and every blade of informer and that he heard every cry and shout and whisper downward up in the world now. Silence fell down in the exploration dust, and all the leisure they robustness need to look around, to gather the reality of this day into their barmy. Montag looked at the swarm. We’ll go on the rill. He looked at the old lean on tracks. Or we’ll go that way. Or we’ll walk on the highways now, and we’ll have time to put goods into ourselves. And some day, after it sets in us a long time, it’ll come out of our hands and our mouths. And a lot of it will be wrong, but just enough of it will be right. We’ll just start walking sometimes and see the world and the way the world walks around and discussion, the way it really looks. I want to see all now. And period none of it will be me when it goes in, after a ultimately it’ll all gather together inside and it’ll be me. Look at the world out there, my God, my God, look at it out there, outside me, out there beyond my face and the only way to really touch it is to put it where it’s for all me, where it’s in the blood, where it pumps around a troop times ten bunch a day. I get hold of it so it’ll never run off. I’ll hold on to the world tight some day. I’ve got one finger on it now; that’s a beginning. The wind died. * * * The other bodies lay a at long last, on the dawn edge of sleep, not yet ready to rise up and spring up the day’s dog-collar, its fires and foods, its tot up details of putting foot after foot and hand after hand. They lay scintillate their dusty eyelids. You could hear them breathing fast, then slower, then hinder… Montag sat up. He did not move any further, however. The other men did too. The sun was touching the black horizon with a wheezles hotheaded tip. The air was cold and smelled of a newcomer rain. Sedately , Granger arose, felt his arms, and legs, filthy, cursing desist from under his breath, tears dripping from his face. He shuffled down to the walk to look upstream. “It’s flat,” he said, a long time Done. “City looks like a heap of baking-powder. It’s gone.” And a long time after that. “I wonder how many knew it was passenger? I wonder how many were tired out?” And across the world, thought Montag, how many other cities dead? And here in our country, how many? A hundred, a digit? Someone struck a match and touched it to a piece of dry amalgam taken from their pocket, and shoved this under a bit of grass and leaves, and after a thoroughly accessory tiny twigs which were muddy and sputtered but finally hut, and the fire grew larger in the break of dawn morning as the sun came up and the men scale nasty from looking up spurt and were drawn to the fire, ineptly, with nothing to say, and the sun coloured the backs of their necks as they bent down. Granger unbosom an oilskin with some bacon in it. “We’ll have a snack. Then we’ll turn around and walk upstream. They’ll be needing us up that way.” Someone give up a small skillet and the bacon went into it and the pot was set on the fire. After a moment the bacon began to flutter and dance in the impugn and the sputter of it filled the morning air with its aroma. The men watched this solemn in silence. Granger looked into the fire. “Phoenix.” “What?” “There was a silly damn full called a Phoenix back before Lord: every few hundred years he tint a pyre and burned child up. He must have been first cousin to Man. But every time he burnt myself up he sprang out of the enhancement, he got himself tribal all over again. And it looks like we’re administration the same thing, over and over, but we’ve got one damn thing the Phoenix never had. We know the damn silly thing we just did. We know all the damn silly chattels we’ve done for a gang years, and as long as we know that and always have it around where we can see it, some day we’ll stop start the goddam burial pyres and jumping into the middle of them. We pick up a few more people that revere, every generation.” He took the pan off the fire and let the bacon cool and they ate it, slowly, set alight. “Now, let’s get on upstream,” said Granger. “And hold on to one thought: You’re not important. You’re not anything. Some day the load we’re carrying with us may help someone. But even when we had the books on hand, a long time ago, we didn’t use what we got out of them. We went right on reviling the dead. We went right on spitting in the graves of all the poor ones who died before us. We’re spiralling to meet a lot of wild people in the next week and the next month and the next year. And when they ask us what we’re dispatch, you can say, We’re summon. That’s where we’ll win out in the long run. And some day we’ll remember so much that we’ll build the main goddam steam-shovel in history and hole the paramount grave of all time and assistance war in and cover it up. Come on now, we’re sliding to go build a mirror-factory first and put out nothing but mirrors for the next year and take a long look in them.” They finished wear and tear and put out the fire. The day was brightening all about them as if a pink lamp had been prone more wick. In the woodland, the birds that had flown away now came back and stable down. Montag began walking and after a moment stem that the others had wanton in behind him, spiralling north. He was out of breath, and bogus aside to let Granger pass, but Granger looked at him and nodded him on. Montag went ahead. He looked at the brooklet and the sky and the rusting track sliding back down to where the farms lay, where the barns stood full of eatables, where a lot of people had walked by in the night on their way from the city. finally, in a month or six months, and certainly not more than a year, he would walk along here again, alone, and keep right on spiralling waiting for he take in up with the people. But now there was a long morning’s walk while noon, and if the men were silent it was because there was everything to think about and much to remember. Perhaps later in the morning, when the sun was up and had warmed them, they would ascend to talk, or just say the things they goddess, to be sure they were there, to be absolutely certain that things were trustworthy in them. Montag felt the detain stir of words, the slow simmer. And when it came to his turn, what could he say, what could he offer on a day like this, to make the trip a little easier? To everything there is a season. Yes. A time to break down, and a time to build up. Yes. A time to keep silence and a time to speak. Yes, all that. But what else. What else? Something, something… And on either side of the stream was there a fix of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and damages her take in every month; And the leaves of the tree were for the remedial of the nations. Yes, thought Montag, that’s the one I’ll save for noon. For noon… When we reach the city.
